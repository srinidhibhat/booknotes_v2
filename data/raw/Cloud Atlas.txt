Cloud Atlas
by David Mitchell

- Peace, though beloved of our Lord, is a cardinal virtue only if your neighbours share your conscience.
- ‘Pain is strong, aye – but friends’ eyes, more strong.’ I told him that he knows next to nothing about me & I know nothing about him. He jabbed at his eyes & jabbed at mine, as if that single gesture were ample explanation.
- 'It’s one thing to throw a blackie a bone, but quite another to take him on for life! Friendships between races, Ewing, can never surpass the affection between a loyal gun-dog & its master.'
- Implausible truth can serve one better than plausible fiction,
- I envy God, too, privy to their secrets. Faith, the least exclusive club on Earth, has the craftiest doorman.
- Most cities are nouns, but New York is a verb.
- Hard evidence isn’t hard evidence if you don’t break your back digging for it.
- Luisa wonders: What level of deceit is permissible in journalism? She remembers her father’s answer, one afternoon in the hospital garden: Did I ever lie to get my story? Ten-mile-high whoppers every day before breakfast, if it got me one inch closer to the truth.
- The dumbest dog can sit and watch. What takes brains is knowing when to look away.
- Though in our age crimes are not committed by criminals conveniently at hand but by executive pens far beyond the mob’s reach, back in London’s postmodern HQs of glass and steel. Half the mob owns shares in what it would pound to atoms, anyway.
- Old Father Timothy offers this advice to his younger readers, included for free in the price of this memoir: conduct your life in such a way that, when your train breaks down in the eve of your years, you have a warm, dry car driven by a loved one – or a hired one, it matters not – to take you home.
- I lost my balance when the train pulled away, but a human crumple zone buffered my fall. We stayed like that, half fallen. The Diagonal People.
- Clocks in disagreement are worse than no clock at all.
- Unlimited power in the hands of limited people always leads to cruelty.
- Fear of discovery waits inside every secret.
- Fear hardens caution, but boredom erodes it.
- Snowflakes settled on my eyelashes and nostrils. If I looked at the sky, I felt I was falling upwards.
- Mephi seemed delited. ‘Try this: fabricants are mirrors held up to purebloods’ consciences; what purebloods see therein sickens them. So they blame the mirrors.’ I asked when purebloods might start blaming themselves. Mephi replied, ‘History suggests not until they are made to.’
- ‘So winners,’ Hae-Joo proposed, ‘are the real losers because they learn nothing?’ What, then, were losers? Winners? I didn’t know if he was being serious. I said, ‘If losers can xploit what their adversaries teach them, yes, losers can become winners in the long term.’
- Lying is harder than purebloods make it look.
- Time is what stops history happening at once; time is the speed at which the past disappears. Film gives those lost worlds a brief resurrection. Those since-fallen buildings, those long-decayed faces, they engrossed me. We were as you are, they said. The present doesn’t matter.
- Misery and embarrassment are hungersome for blame.
- O, bein’ young ain’t easy ’cos ev’rythin’ you’re puzzlin’n’anxin’ you’re puzzlin’n’anxin’ it for the first time.
- See you’ll b’lief in a mil’yun diff’rent b’liefin’s if you reck’n jus’ one of ’em may aid you.
- A mountain you’re plannin’ on climbin’ ain’t the same as the one you ain’t.
- There ain’t no journey what don’t change you some.
- I knowed I’d be payin’ for it by’n’by but, like I said a while back, in our busted world the right thing ain’t always possible.
- List’n, savages an’ Civilizeds ain’t divvied by tribes or b’liefs or mountain ranges nay, ev’ry human is both, yay. Old’uns’d got the Smart o’ gods but the savagery o’ jackals an’ that’s what tripped the Fall. Some savages what I knowed got a beautsome Civ’lized heart beatin’ in their ribs. Maybe some Kona. Not ’nuff to say-so their hole tribe, but who knows one day? One day.
- I don’t understand how you didn’t recognize this as sheerest fantasy? All revolutions are the sheerest fantasy until they happen; then they become historical inevitabilities.
- Mother used to say escape is never further than the nearest book.
- ‘We – by whom I mean anyone over sixty – commit two offences just by existing. One is Lack of Velocity. We drive too slowly, walk too slowly, talk too slowly. The world will do business with dictators, perverts and drug barons of all stripes, but being slowed down, it cannot abide. Our second offence is being Everyman’s memento mori. The world can only get comfy in shiny-eyed denial if we are out of sight.’
- ‘The most singular difference between happiness and joy is that happiness is a solid, and joy a liquid,’
- Ernie had never read a work of fiction in his life, ‘Always a radio man, me,’ but watching him coax the Victorian boiler system into life one more time, I always felt shallow. It’s true, reading too many novels makes you go blind.
- Three or four times only in my youth did I glimpse the Joyous Isles, before they were lost to fogs, depressions, cold fronts, ill winds and contrary tides … I mistook them for adulthood. Assuming they were a fixed feature in my life’s voyage, I neglected to record their latitude, their longitude, their approach. Young ruddy fool. What wouldn’t I give now for a never-changing map of the ever-constant ineffable? To possess, as it were, an atlas of clouds.
- Was he so sure another war was coming? ‘Another war is always coming, Robert. They are never properly extinguished. What sparks wars? The will to power, the backbone of human nature. The threat of violence, the fear of violence, or actual violence, is the instrument of this dreadful will. You can see the will to power in bedrooms, kitchens, factories, unions and the borders of states. Listen to this and remember it. The nation state is merely human nature inflated to monstrous proportions. QED (meaning, *what was to be shown*), nations are entities whose laws are written by violence. Thus it ever was, so ever shall it be. War, Robert, is one of humanity’s two eternal companions.’ So, I asked, what was the other? ‘Diamonds.’
- Nothing is more tiresome than being told what to admire, and having things pointed at with a stick.
- Wars are never cured, they just go into remission for a few years. The End is what we want, so I’m afraid the End is what we’re damn well going to get.
- Why tinker with the plain truth that we hurry the darker races to their graves in order to take their land & its riches? Wolves don’t sit in their caves, concocting crapulous theories of race to justify devouring a flock of sheep!
- ‘No, Rafael, the Lord cannot forgive a planned suicide, for repentance cannot be true if it occurs before the crime,’
- Scholars discern motions in history & formulate these motions into rules that govern the rises & falls of civilizations. My belief runs contrary, however. To wit: history admits no rules; only outcomes.
- One fine day, a purely predatory world shall consume itself. Yes, the devil shall take the hindmost until the foremost is the hindmost. In an individual, selfishness uglifies the soul; for the human species, selfishness is extinction. Is this the entropy written within our nature? If we believe that humanity may transcend tooth & claw, if we believe divers races & creeds can share this world as peaceably as the orphans share their candlenut tree, if we believe leaders must be just, violence muzzled, power accountable & the riches of the Earth & its Oceans shared equitably, such a world will come to pass. I am not deceived. It is the hardest of worlds to make real. Tortuous advances won over generations can be lost by a single stroke of a myopic president’s pen or a vainglorious general’s sword.
- He who would do battle with the many-headed hydra of human nature must pay a world of pain & his family must pay it along with him! & only as you gasp your dying breath shall you understand, your life amounted to no more than one drop in a limitless ocean!’ Yet what is any ocean but a multitude of drops?
