Think on These Things
by Jiddu Krishnamurty

- The moment you want to be somebody you are no longer free. But the man or the woman who sees the absurdity of all these things and whose heart is therefore innocent, and therefore not moved by the desire to be somebody - such a person is free.
- Most of us merely survive; we somehow drag along, and therefore life becomes a dreadful thing. Really to live requires a great deal of love, a great feeling for silence, a great simplicity with an abundance of experience; it requires a mind that is capable of thinking very clearly, that is not bound by prejudice or superstition, by hope or fear.
- You cannot learn how to love, but what you can do is to observe hate and put it gently aside.
- If you can observe alertly, keenly, but without judging, without concluding, you will find that your thinking becomes astonishingly acute. Then you are learning all the time.
- Happiness is something which is not within the field of self-consciousness. When you try to be good, are you good? Can goodness be practised? Or is goodness something that comes naturally because you see, observe, understand? Similarly, when you are conscious that you are happy, happiness goes out of the window. To seek happiness is absurd, because there is happiness only when you don't seek it.
- Watch how your mind works. It is really very interesting, far more interesting than any film, because your mind is the residue of the whole world, and it contains all that human beings have experienced. Do you understand? Your mind is humanity, and when you perceive this, you will have immense compassion. Out of this understanding comes great love; and then you will know, when you see lovely things, what beauty is.
- Your aim should not be to find your destiny. You have to be free of it.
- Relationship is a mirror in which you can see yourself, not as you would wish to be, but as you are.
- Sir, life is very strange. The moment you are very clear about what you want to do, things happen.
- When you invite life, things begin to happen. But, you see, we don't want to invite life;we want to play a safe game, and those who play a safe game die very safely.
- Try it for a day-put aside everything you know, forget it, and just see what happens. Don't carry over your worries from day to day, from hour to hour, from moment to moment; let them all go, and you will see that out of this freedom there comes an extraordinary life that includes both living and dying. Death is only the ending of something, and in that very ending there is a renewing.
- Life is something to be discovered, and you cannot discover it if you have not lost, if you have not put aside the things that you have found.
- If you listen both to the sound of the bell and to the silence between its strokes, the whole of that listening is attention. Similarly, when someone is speaking, attention is the giving of your mind not only to the words but also to the silence between the words. If you experiment with this, you will find that your mind can pay complete attention without distraction and without resistance. When you discipline your mind by saying, 'I must not look out of the window, I must not watch the people coming in, I must pay attention even though I want to do something else', it creates a division which is very destructive because it dissipates the energy of the mind. But if you listen comprehensively so that there is no division and therefore no form of resistance, then you will find that the mind can pay complete attention to anything without effort.
- Use your mind to examine what you mean when you talk about having a good time-find out what is actually involved in it; don't go by what your parents or your ideals say. Use your mind to discover why you don't want to study. Use your mind to find out what you want to do in life-what 'you' want to do, not what society or some ideal tells you to do. If you give your whole being to this inquiry, then you are a revolutionary; then you have the confidence to create, to be what you are, and in that there is an ever-renewing vitality.
- The difficulty is to free the mind from the known so that it can discover what is new all the time. One must have information about a problem, but the mind must be free of that information to find the answer.
- As a river creates the banks which hold it, so the energy which seeks truth creates its own discipline without any form of imposition, and as the river finds the sea, so that energy finds its own freedom.
- Happiness does not come into being when you seek it; it is a by-product, it comes into being when there is goodness, when there is love, when there is no ambition, when the mind is quietly seeking out what is true.
