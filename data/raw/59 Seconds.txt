59 Seconds: Think a Little, Change a Lot
by Richard Wiseman

- Those who do not feel in control of their lives are less successful, and less psychologically and physically healthy, than those who do feel in control.
- Happiness doesn't just flow from success, it actually causes it. 
- When people can afford the necessities in life, an increase in income does not result in a significantly happier life. 
- The sentence "Remove negative thoughts from your head" is dumb. It's like saying "Do not think of a polar bear," you will see that the cursed thing come to mind every minute. 
- Several studies prove that writing about your sorrows (deepest thought and feelings) is far more effective - than sharing sorrows with others - in reducing the sorrow.
- **Try to buy experiences, not goods. Go for a vacation instead of buying something. Experiences are blissful and long lasting. Products fade away with time.**
- When something is attached with reward, it becomes weak. They will not enjoy doing the work. If you tell a child to draw and promise him a medal if he did well, he'll think "people reward things for the work I don't like doing. I don't like to draw." Children won't do the work. Instead, give surprise rewards and praise them with cheesy words. 
- Interview tips: If you have a weakness that affects the company, tell it at the beginning of the interview (or at least in middle). If you want to tell your strength, just slip it in your conversation towards the end of the interview. these two tips makes you more likeable. 
- To increase your popularity or likeability, express a genuine interest in others around you than trying to make others interested in you. 
- To encourage others to like you, ask for their help (small ones, of course). "We do not love people so much for the good they have done us, as for the good we do them."
- Nobody likes a person who is totally perfect. As you near to perfectness, committing a small mistake may increase your likeability. 
- When you spread malicious gossip about your friends to others, you will end up less likeable person. Always speak pleasant things about your friends and relatives. 
- We like people who are like us, and we find them far more persuasive than others. 
- If you want to up the chances of a lost wallet being returned, tuck in a photo of cutest happiest baby you an find and make sure that it is prominently displayed. 
- To bring change in life, follow these steps:
    1. What is your overall goal?
    2. Create a step-by-step plan (max. 5 steps) - Each sub-goal  should be associated with rewards.
    3. What are the benefits of achieving your overall goal?
    4. Tell others about your goals.
- Imagine the *process* of achieving the goal rather than achieving the goal. Imagine training than winning. 
- Many studies prove that working alone is far more productive than group brainstorming. In groups, people face bystander effect. 
- Salvador Dali's technique to put your unconscious mind to work:
    - Lie on a couch and put a glass on the floor. 
    - Carefully place one end of a spoon on the edge of the glass and lightly hold the other end in hand.
    - As you drift off to sleep, you would naturally relax your hand and release the spoon. The sound of spoon falling into glass will wake you up, and you should immediately sketch (write down) bizarre images that had just started to drift through your half-asleep, semi-conscious mind. 
- Your conscious mind is a loud guy - less innovative but more dominating. Your unconscious mind is a quiet guy - more innovative and creative, but often difficult to hear. 
- Everybody can be more creative - it is just a matter of keeping the loud guy in your head busy and giving the quiet guy a chance to speak up. 
- 4 techniques to make you think clearly:
    1. Priming: work hard on a topic for some time, then completely change your attention on some peaceful job, come back. 
    2. Perspective: change perspectives. Try imagining how a child, idiot, friend would approach the problem. 
    3. Play: Take a break. Have fun. Relax.
    4. Perceive: Switch your mind to manual by becoming more curious about the world. (Ex: Why do we laugh? Why bananas are yello? etc.)
- To inspire creative thoughts, place plants and flowers in the room. 
- Not only do our thoughts and feelings affect the way we act, but the way we act influences our thoughts and feelings. 
- For a relationship to succeed, the frequency of positive comments has to outweigh negative remarks by about five to one i.e. it takes 5 instances of agreement and support to undo the harm caused by single criticism. 
- When it comes to anger management, putting on the boxing gloves or punching a pillow is far likely to increase feelings of aggression. Instead, it is possible to significantly reduce such feelings by focusing on the benefits that emerged from the seemingly negative events underlying your anger. 
- When it comes to improving your health, you may already be putting in the necessary effort. It is just a case of realizing that. 
- People are far more likely to agree to a big request if they have already agreed to a small one. 
- When you praise children, do not praise their achievements, talents or abilities. Instead, praise their hard work and be specific about it.
