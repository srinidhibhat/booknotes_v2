MINDSET - UPDATED EDITION: CHANGING THE WAY YOU THINK TO FULFIL YOUR POTENTIAL
by Carol Dweck
- The view you adopt for yourself profoundly affects the way you lead your life.
- “Becoming is better than being.”
- You can look back and say, “I could have been . . . ,” polishing your unused endowments like trophies. Or you can look back and say, “I gave my all for the things I valued.” Think about what you want to look back and say. Then choose your mindset.
- Test scores and measures of achievement tell you where a student is, but they don’t tell you where a student could end up.
- Just because some people can do something with little or no training, it doesn’t mean that others can’t do it (and sometimes do it even better) with training.
- A growth mindset helps people to see prejudice for what it is—someone else’s view of them—and to confront it with their confidence and abilities intact.
- “After every game or practice, if you walk off the field knowing that you gave everything you had, you will always be a winner.”
- One of the most destructive beliefs for a relationship is “If we need to work at it, there’s something seriously wrong with our relationship.”
- Are you shy? Then you really need the growth mindset. Even if it doesn’t cure your shyness, it will help keep it from messing up your social interactions. Next time you’re venturing into a social situation, think about these things: how social skills are things you can improve and how social interactions are for learning and enjoyment, not judgment. Keep practicing this.
- “Praise should deal, not with the child’s personality attributes, but with his efforts and achievements.”
- Growth mindset is about believing people can develop their abilities. It’s that simple.
- Parents, teachers, and coaches pass on a growth mindset not by having a belief sitting in their heads but by embodying a growth mindset in their deeds: the way they praise (conveying the processes that lead to learning), the way they treat setbacks (as opportunities for learning), and the way they focus on deepening understanding (as the goal of learning).
- Mindset change is not about picking up a few pointers here and there. It’s about seeing things in a new way. When people—couples, coaches and athletes, managers and workers, parents and children, teachers and students—change to a growth mindset, they change from a judge-and-be-judged framework to a learn-and-help-learn framework. Their commitment is to growth, and growth takes plenty of time, effort, and mutual support to achieve and maintain.
- Change can be tough, but I’ve never heard anyone say it wasn’t worth it.
