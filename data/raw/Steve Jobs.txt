Steve Jobs 
by Walter Isaacson

- Religion was at its best when it emphasized spiritual experiences rather than received dogma.
- Turning thirty is a milestone for most people, especially those of the generation that proclaimed it would never trust anyone over that age.
- He averted his gaze. "Can't you look me in the eyes when I'm talking to you?" she asked. But when Jobs did so giving her his practiced, unblinking stare - she recoiled. "Never mind, don't look at me," she said. "When I look into most people's eyes, I see a soul. When I look into your eyes, I see a bottomless pit, an empty hole, a dead zone."
- Hewlett and Packard built a great company, and they thought they had left it in good hands," he said. "But now it's being dismembered and destroyed. It's tragic. I hope I've left a stronger legacy so that will never happen at Apple."
- That evening, he stressed to me that his hope was to remain as active as his health allowed. "I'm going to work on new products and marketing and the things that I like," he said. But when I asked how it really felt to be relinquishing control of the company he had built, his tone turned wistful, and he shifted into the past tense. "I've had a very lucky career, a very lucky life," he replied. "I've done all that I can do."
- For Jobs, belief in an integrated approach was a matter of righteousness. "We do these things not because we are control freaks," he explained. "We do them because we want to make great products, because we care about the user, and because we like to take responsibility for the entire experience rather than turn out the crap that other people make." He also believed he was doing people a service: "They're busy doing whatever they do best, and they want us to do what we do best. Their lives are crowded; they have other things to do than think about how to integrate their computers and devices."
- Dozens of colleagues whom jobs most abused ended their litany of horror stories by saying that he got them to do things they never dreamed possible. And he created a corporation crammed with A players.
- What drove me? I think most creative people want to express appreciation for being able to take advantage of the work that's been done by others before us. I didn't invent the language or mathematics I use. I make little of my own food, none of my own clothes. Everything I do depends on other members of our species and the shoulders that we stand on. And a lot of us want to contribute something back to our species and to add something to the flow. It's about trying to express something in the only way that most of us know how-because we can't write Bob Dylan songs or Tom Stoppard plays. We try to use the talents we do have to express our deep feelings, to show our appreciation of all the contributions that came before us, and to add something to that flow. That's what has driven me.
- He admitted that, as he faced death, he might be overestimating the odds out of a desire to believe in an afterlife. "I like to think that something survives after you die," he said. "It's strange to think that you accumulate all this experience, and maybe a little wisdom, and it just goes away. So I really want to believe that something survives, that maybe your consciousness endures."
He fell silent for a very long time. "But on the other hand, perhaps it's like an on-off switch," he said. "Click! And you're gone."
Then he paused again and smiled slightly. "Maybe that's why I never liked to put on-off switches on Apple devices."
- That Tuesday afternoon, he kept staring into his children's eyes. At one point he looked at Patty and his children for a long time, then at Laurene, and finally gazed past them into the distance. "Oh wow," he said. "Oh wow. Oh wow". Those were his final words before he drifted into unconsciousness.
