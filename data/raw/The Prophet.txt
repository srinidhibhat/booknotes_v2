The Prophet
Kahlil Gibran

- And ever has it been that love knows not its own depth until the hour of separation.
- All you have shall some day be given; Therefore give now, that the season of giving may be yours and not your inheritors'.
- When you are joyous, look deep into your heart and you shall find it is only that which has given you sorrow that is giving you joy. When you are sorrowful, look again in your heart, and you shall see that in truth you are weeping for that which has been your delight.
- And forget not that the earth delights to feel your bare feet and the winds long to play with your hair.
- Rest in reason, move in passion.
- For what is your friend that you should seek him with hours to kill? Seek him always with hours to live. For it is his to fill your need, but not your emptiness. And in the sweetness of friendship let there be laughter, and sharing of pleasures. For in the dew of little things the heart finds its morning and is refreshed.
- And now you ask in your heart, 'How shall we distinguish that which is good in pleasure from that which is not good?'
Go to your fields and your gardens, and you shall learn that it is the pleasure of the bee to gather honey of the flower,
But it is also the pleasure of the flower to yield its honey to the bee. 
For to the bee a flower is a fountain of life, And to the flower a bee is a messenger of love, And to both, bee and flower, the giving and the receiving of pleasure is a need and an ecstasy.
Be in your pleasures like the flowers and the bees.
- That whenever I come to the fountain to drink I find the living water itself thirsty;
And it drinks me while I drink it.
- That which seems most feeble and bewildered in you is the strongest and most determined.
It is not your breath that has erected and hardened the structure of your bones?
And is it not a dream which none of you remember having dreamt, that builded your city and fashioned all there is in it?
