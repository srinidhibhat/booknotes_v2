Long Walk to Freedom
by Nelson Mandela

- I was seven years old, and on the day before I was to begin school, my father took me aside and told me that I must be dressed properly for school. Until that time, I, like all the other boys in Qunu, had worn only a blanket, which was wrapped round one shoulder and pinned at the waist. My father took a pair of his trousers and cut them at the knee. He told me to put them on, which I did, and they were roughly the correct length, although the waist was far too large. My father then took a piece of string and drew the trousers in at the waist. I must have been a comical sight, but I have never owned a suit I was prouder to wear than my father's cut-off trousers.
- There is nothing like returning to a place that remains unchanged to find the ways in which you yourself have altered.
- A freedom fighter learns the hard way that it is the oppressor who defines the nature of the struggle, and the oppressed is often left no recourse but to use methods that mirror those of the oppressor. At a certain point, one can only fight fire with fire.
- I wondered - not for the first time - whether one was ever justified in neglecting the welfare of one's own family in order to fight for the welfare of others. Can there be anything more important than looking after one's ageing mother? Is politics merely a pretext for shirking one's responsibilities, an excuse for not being able to provide in the way one wanted?
- But instead of sleeping like a child in my old bed, I tossed and turned that night, again wondering whether or not I had taken the right path. I did not doubt that I had chosen correctly. I do not mean to suggest that the freedom struggle is of a higher moral order than taking care of one's family. It is not; they are merely different.
- Our communal cell became a kind of convention for far-flung freedom fighters. Many of us had been living under severe restrictions, making it illegal for us to meet and talk. Now, our enemy had gathered us all under one roof for what became the largest and longest unbanned meeting of the Congress Alliance in years.
- The wife of a freedom fighter is often like a widow, even when her husband is not in prison.
- It was a useful reminder that all men even the most seemingly cold-blooded, have a core of decency, and that if their hearts are touched, they are capable of changing. Ultimately Badenhorst was not evil; his inhumanity had been foisted upon him by an inhuman system. He behaved like a brute because he was rewarded for brutish behaviour.
- She married a man who soon left her, that man became a myth; and then that myth returned home and proved to be just a man after all.
- It seems to be the destiny of freedom fighters to have unstable personal lives. When your life is the struggle, as mine was, there is little room left for family. That has always been my greatest regret, and the most painful aspect of the choice I made.
- We watched our children growing without our guidance, and when we did come out of prison, my children said, "We thought we had a father and one day he'd come back. But to our dismay, our father came back and he left us alone because he has now become the father of the nation." To be the father of a nation is a great honour, but to be the father of a family is a greater joy. But it was a joy I had far too little of.
