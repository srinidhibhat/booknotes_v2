DON'T LOSE YOUR MIND, LOSE YOUR WEIGHT
by Rujuta Diwekar
- There is no bravery attached to weight loss. You can achieve it just by falling sick. What is most important is that you feel good about yourself, treat yourself well, be committed to eating properly and exercising; and weight loss, rather fat loss, will just happen.
- Fat occupies a lot of volume on the body and weighs very little. Muscle, is denser, so it occupies much less space but will weigh a lot. (Compare fat to 1 kilo cotton and muscle to 1 kilo iron.
- So eat your fruit, but don’t think that it’s safer than eating a dessert. Its nutrients only work for us if we eat it at as a meal by itself: as a morning meal or after exercise, and not as a dessert after dinner.
- When it comes to fruit—eat, don’t drink.
- Trust me, adopting a healthy lifestyle is not as difficult as staying loyal in a marriage or loving your partner for a lifetime. It’s much more difficult because it means unconditional love and acceptance of your own self and of your body.
- Cheat sheet Don’t ever go on extreme diets—they’re not sustainable and just don’t work. Dieting should not involve starving yourself: you must eat to lose weight. Don’t make angels and demons out of different foods: they’re all just as good or bad for you. Just as everyone is different, everyone’s diets have to be different too. Don’t try someone else’s regime. Make sure you know what’s in low fat or sugar free foods; they aren’t all that healthy, and shouldn’t be consumed in excess. Exercise is non-negotiable. Unless you exercise, you’ll never see enough of a result, despite all your good eating habits. Never go on a diet: modify your lifestyle.
- Don’t store sweets or fried foods at home.
- The stomach is actually the size of 2 palms. The food it can take at a time is the amount that fits in your 2 palms.
- Savour every bit of what you eat, slowly and mindfully, and you will naturally find your threshold. All you need to train yourself to do, is to be attentive to your stomach.
- Guidelines Before eating: Switch off your phone, TV and computer. Wash your hands (use a soap). Serve yourself half of what you usually eat, on a nice, clean plate. Preferably adopt the crosslegged posture or sit at your usual dining place. While eating: Drink a glass of water. Start eating (preferably with your hands) and eat slowly. Chew your food slowly and deliberately. Use the entire mouth and don’t just chew from 1 side of your jaw. While you still have food in your mouth don’t pick up the food from your plate (Keeping food ready in your hands or on your spoon means you are eating fast and will ultimately overeat.) Eat with all your senses and think about how the food is nourishing you from within. Now if you want to eat some more, serve yourself a second helping from the other half that’s left. But don’t eat it all. After eating Don’t be in a rush to get up and get going. Stay where you are for a few minutes. If you’re clearing up yourself, pick up your plate and clean it with water before leaving it in the sink. (Food that dries up on the plate will sometimes stay on the plate even after washing, and can cause stomach discomfort at a later point.)
- Carbs, protein and fats are called macro nutrients because our body needs them in higher amounts, and vitamins and minerals are called micro nutrients because they are needed in smaller amounts. Also, 70% of our body is water, so this is something that our body needs all the time.
- Every calorie we consume should be loaded with nutrients.
- Cheat sheet The key to eating right is to focus while you eat: switch off the TV and mobile phone. You can digest the most amount of food between 7 am and 10 am. Stress can make you fat. Last night’s sabzi and dal retain very little nutrition the day after. Think global eat local; eat dosas in Chennai, momos in Ladakh and pasta in Italy. Stay close to your genes: as much as possible eat the food you and your family have grown up eating. Tell your body when you’re about to indulge and it will help you deal with the extra fat you’re going to be eating. It’s better for you to have a paneer paratha than a pizza. How many nutrients a food has is much more important than how many calories.
- High GI foods (fast carbs) get converted to fat quickly and low GI foods (slow carbs) have a much better chance of getting utilised for energy instead of getting stored as fat.
- Carbs you should never eat (these are high GI and zero on nutrient) And how to cheat on them 1. Biscuit Eat them when you’ve done a very long physical activity like trekking, 2 or more hours of walking or shopping. In day to day life, restrict to one a week! I think biscuits are more harmful than cakes and pastries because no one worries about scarfing them down. 2. Cakes and pastries If you can’t bear to give up your favourite chocolate pastry, you’re in for good news. Have it first thing in the morning. Don’t replace your nutritious meal with this but have it in addition to it. Croissant lovers go ahead as well. But don’t indulge yourself more than once or twice a month. 3. Pizza One slice (we’re talking fast food pizza) and as a meal by itself. Perfect for after a long boring meeting. 4. Drink syrups, cold drinks (all drinks made from these, including sherbets, etc) After being out in the sun for a long while; the sugar will have less of an effect. Also after a long day or if you’re on holiday, have one every 2 to 3 days. 5. Mithais and all desserts (chocolates, etc included) Eat as a meal by itself. Have your mithai either an hour and a half after your lunch, or first thing in the morning. Again not more than once a month, if you have to have it! 6. Deep-fried food like samosas, pakoras, vada, bhujiya and kachori Eat first thing in the morning. Halve your first meal and have your deep-fried goody along with it, or as a meal by itself later in the afternoon. But restrict yourself to only one of these. And do not eat a mithai with it. You can have one of these treats once a week, but again only if you’re eating correctly all seven days and working out at least three hours a week. 7. Sugar 2 teaspoons a day max. Most of you have this in your tea or coffee, so bear this in mind… 8. Alcohol With a meal or after a meal. Never on an empty stomach and never have anything deep-fried with it. Carbs to eat through the day that ensure optimum fat burning and sustained release of blood sugar (these are low GI foods): Carbs to be consumed after exercise or any stressful activity (high GI foods): Phulkas or rotis made from gehu or wholewheat atta, jowar, bajra and nachni/ragi. Also idli, dosa, uttapam, appam, neer dosa, upma, brown rice, wholewheat bread, oats, barley, semolina/ rawa/suji, vegetable parathas, koki, homemade khakra, dhokla, iddada, besan or mung dal dosa, chillas, sweet potatoes, unripe banana, all lentils. Boiled potato All fruits White rice and dal White bread sandwiches or toast Fruit juices Homemade ladoos How to eat them How to eat them With vegetables and in small quantities. They can be part of your breakfast, lunch and an evening meal by 5:30-6 pm. Within ten minutes of your workout. I don’t usually recommend fruit juices but this is a safe time to have it. As for rice and dal, for anyone who works out at home, this could be an option depending on when you workout. You can also eat fruits first thing in the morning.
- One thing that will turn exercise into an anti ageing activity is protein.
- If you can’t arrange for your post workout meal to have protein and high GI carb, you are better off not working out. Just like if you don’t have money for petrol you are better off not driving.
- When too much of protein is consumed at one time, it doesn’t get stacked away for future use, instead it is converted to fat by a process called deamination.
- Saturated fats These are solid at room temperature: butter, animal fats (especially red meat), milk and milk products, coconut and palm oil.
- Unsaturated fats These are fats which are liquid at room temperature; so all oils except for coconut oil.
- Lot of us, had bought into the marketing gimmick of ‘low fat’, what is technically called ‘invisible fat’. Which means that when you pick up the chakli, biscuit or chips, you don’t see the fat in them so you are led to believe that they will not get converted to fat. In the homemade deep-fried chakli or pakora, or in the ghee on roti, you can see the oil in the kadhai and on the food item: this is called visible fat. So we think, ‘I am eating fat, it will get converted to fat.’ The truth is, however, that foods with invisible fat are full of the bad fat, trans fat, which is responsible for causing heart attacks, insulin insensitivity, etc.
- So don’t move that fat out of your diet. Instead start getting the fat in your body moving and working!
- Vitamins and minerals don’t provide our body with any energy or calories but they are important so that we can use our energy or calories well.
- Himalayan locals eat so much more fibre than we do. Fibre is high in unprocessed foods and thus retains most of its nutrients. In fact all people who live close to nature eat in that way. We don’t. And that’s why we need supplements. The processed food we eat and the pace of our life is taking all the nutrients away from our food.
- How much water should you drink? Drink enough so that your urine is always crystal clear, not light yellow, dark yellow or reddish.
- The physical body, what we can see in the mirror is called annamaya kosha according to yoga or yogic philosophy (roughly translated as food body). It’s a straight reflection of ‘anna’ or the food we eat and what time we eat it.
- Eating first thing in the morning will lead to an Increase in blood sugar and energy levels, which will lead to an… Increase in metabolic rate and fat burning, and a… Decrease in acidity and bloating, and will… Reduce chances of overeating later in the day, and… Stabilise blood sugar levels throughout the day, which means… Less chances of getting fat.
- So in short, eating after every 2 hours will lead to A conducive environment in the body to burn fat Fewer calories converted to fat Less dependence on stimulants Smarter thinking, because the brain gets a regular flow of sugar Flatter stomach, no need to hold on to fat stores
- If deprivation of food is punishment then overeating is a crime.
- No food is fattening. You have to just be smart enough to choose the right time to eat it.
- We need to up our eating during high demand periods and cut down when relaxing.
- To summarise Eating more food when you’re more active will make your body an efficient calorie burner… Which will increase the metabolic rate of your body… Which will help you stay energetic through the day… And will help you lose fat more effectively.
- When weight loss comes without healthy changes in lifestyle, stretchmarks are just one of the signs of abuse that you have put your body through.
- To eat 2 hours before bedtime will lead to Most of your food being digested before you go to bed… Which will lead to sound sleep… Which will leave your body free to do its repair work… Which will make your body more effective in burning fat.
- Everybody knows that they should be avoiding sweets and fried stuff. Everybody. Even your gulli ka kutta. Then how come so many people are still eating them? It’s simple: they lack complete awareness about what they are stuffing their mouths with. Information without awareness is like riding a bike with the helmet on the handle. You have the right equipment but it’s not in the right place.
- Eating food for entertainment is a sure shot way of getting fat.
- Our body is blessed with ‘muscle memory’. So if you have a high amount of accumulated fitness time or if you have been regularly exercising 20 to 30 years ago, you will quickly recover your fitness levels to what they used to be before you quit working out.
- The tongue has to know that you are in control.
- ‘results’ start happening from minute 1 of exercise, whether you see them or not.
