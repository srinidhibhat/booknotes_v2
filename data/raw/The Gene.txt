The Gene
by Siddhartha Mukerjee
- Embedded in the history of the Gene is "the quest for eternal youth, the Faustian myth of abrupt reversal of fortune, and our own century's flirtation with the perfectibility of man." Embedded, equally, is the desire to decipher our manual of instructions. 
- Freaks became norms, and norms became extinct. Monster by monster, evolution advanced. 
- A chicken was merely an egg's way of making a better egg.
- Memories sharpen the past; it is reality that decays.
- Life maybe chemistry; but it's a special circumstance of chemistry. Organisms exist not because of reactions that are possible, but because of reactions that are barely possible. Too much reactivity and we would spontaneously combust. Too little, and we would turn cold and die. Proteins enable these barely possible reactions, allowing us to live on the edges of chemical entropy - skating perilously, but never falling in.
- The complex workings of living beings can be perceived in terms of these layers: physics enabling chemistry, and chemistry enabling physiology. To Schr√∂dinger's question, "What is life?" a biochemist might answer, "If not chemicals." And what are chemicals - a biophysicist might add - if not molecules of matter.
- X-ray pictures would help, of course - but trying to determine structures of biological molecules using experimental methods, Crick argued, was absurdly laborious - "like trying to determine the structure of a piano by listening to the sound it made while being dropped down a flight of stairs".
- We see it as rather stubby double helix, for they seldom show its other striking feature: it is immensely long and thin. In every cell in your body, you have two meters of the stuff; if we were to draw a scaled-up picture of it with the DNA as thick as sewing thread, that cell's worth would be about 200 kilometers long.
- DNA provided instructions to build RNA. RNA provided instructions to build proteins. Proteins ultimately enabled structure and function - bringing genes to life.
- The gene was the lens through which chance was filtered and refracted. 
- That humans and worms have about the same number of genes-around twenty thousand - and yet the fact that only one of these two organisms is capable of paintings ceiling of the Sistine Chapel suggests that the number of genes is largely unimportant to the physiological complexity of the organism. "It is not what you have," as a certain Brazilian samba instructor once told me, "it is what you do with it."
- Genetics, like any language, is built out of basic structural elements - alphabet, vocabulary, syntax, and grammar. The "alphabet" of genes has four letters: the four bases of DNA - A, C, G, and T. The "vocabulary" consists of the triplet code: three bases of DNA are read together to encode one amino acid in a protein; ACT encodes Threonine, CAT encodes Histidine, GGT encodes Glycine, and so forth. A protein is the "sentence" coded by a gene, using alphabets strung together in a chain (ACT-CAT GGT encodes Threonine-Histidine-Glycine). And the regulation of genes, as Monod and Jacob had discovered, creates a context for these words and sentences to generate meaning. The regulatory sequences appended to a gene - i.e., signals to turn a gene on or off at certain times and in certain cells - can be imagined as the internal grammar of the genome.
- Proteins are the hubs of biological world. They are the enablers and disablers, the machinators, the regulators, the gatekeepers, the operators, of cellular reactions. They are the switches that most drugs seek to turn on and off. 
- In principle, any illness with a sufficiently powerful genetic link could be intervened upon by prenatal testing and selective abortion. The "right to be born" could be rephrased as a right to be born with the right kind of genes. 
- Once molecular biologists had discovered techniques by which they themselves could manipulate DNA, there emerged a technological know-how that decisively altered our historical sense of the immutability of nature.
- Where the traditional view had been that 'nature' spelt destiny and 'nurture' freedom, now the roles appeared to be reversed. We could more readily control the former [i.e., genes], than the latter [i.e., the environment] - not simply as a long-term goal but as an immediate prospect.
- The human genome encodes about 20,687 genes in total - only 1,796 more than worms, 12,000 fewer than corn, and 25,000 fewer genes than rice or wheat. The difference between "human" and "breakfast cereal" is not a matter of gene numbers, but of the sophistication of gene networks. It not what we have; it is how we use it.
- Intelligence, in short, is heritable (i.e., influenced by genes), but not easily inheritable (i.e., moved down intact from one generation to the next).
- "When nobody read, dyslexia wasn't a problem. When most people had to hunt, a minor genetic variation in your ability to focus attention was hardly a problem and may even have been an advantage (enabling a hunter to maintain his focus on multiple and simultaneous targets, for instance). When people have to make it through high school, the same variation can become a life-altering disease."
- Separated by geographic and economic continents, when two brothers, estranged at birth, were brought to tears by the same Chopin nocturne at night, they seemed to be responding to some subtle, common chord struck by their genomes.
- An upright organism with opposable thumbs is thus built from a script, but built to go off script. We call one such unique variant of one such organism a "self". 
- When an antelope strains its neck to reach a tall tree, its genes do not record that effort, and its children are not born as giraffes. Rather, giraffes arise via spontaneous variation and natural selection: a tall-necked mutant appears in an ancestral tree-grazing animal, and during a period of famine, this mutant survives and is naturally selected.
- Evolution can craft perfectly adapted organisms, but not in an intentional mannet: it is not just a "blind watchmaker", but also a forgetful one. Its sole driver is survival and selection; its only memory is mutation.
- It is a world inhabited by "previvors" and "post-humans": men and women who have been screened for genetic vulnerabilities or created with altered genetic propensities. Illness might progressively vanish, but so might identity. Grief might be diminished, but so might tenderness. Traumas might be erased but so might history. Mutants would be eliminated but so would human variation. Infirmities might disappear, but so might vulnerability. Chance would become mitigated, but so, inevitably, would choice.
- But what is "natural"? I wonder. On one hand: variation, mutation, change, inconstancy, divisibility, flux. And on the other: constancy, permanence, indivisibility, fidelity. Bhed. Abhed. It should hardly surprise as that DNA, the molecule of contradictions, encodes an organism of contradictions. We seek constancy in heredity-and find its opposite: variation. Mutants are necessary to maintain the essence of our selves. Our genome has negotiated a fragile balance between counterpoised forces, pairing strand with opposing strand, mixing past and future, pitting memory against desire. It is the most human of all things that we possess. Its stewardship may be the ultimate test of knowledge and discernment for our species.
