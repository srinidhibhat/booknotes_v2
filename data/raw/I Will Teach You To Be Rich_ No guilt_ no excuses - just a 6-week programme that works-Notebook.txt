I WILL TEACH YOU TO BE RICH
by Ramit Sethi
- The single most important factor to getting rich is getting started, not being the smartest person in the room.
- Before you go further, I encourage you to set your goals today. Why do you want to be rich? What do you want to do with your wealth?
- One of the best ways to improve your chances of getting fees waived is by keeping track of every time you call your financial institutions.
- But it’s not just about your immediate earnings—being young is about developing the right habits.
- DON’T JUST SAVE— SAVE FOR A GOAL It’s Hard to Save Unless There’s a Reason
- MAKE THE TRADEOFFS WORTHWHILE. Having a goal means that you are working toward something concrete. It gives you a reason to make those tradeoffs. You don’t just think of that $5 saved as $5—instead it is something that gets you closer to your goal of having $20,000 for a down payment on a home. It changes the entire motivation for saving.
- Ask yourself if you’d rather spend $10 on lunch or save $10 toward a house or a car. If you would rather spend the money on lunch, by all means enjoy lunch! You save money so that you can spend it later on the things that make you happy. You don’t save money just to watch your account balance grow. Once you list your goals and start making those trade-offs, you’ll realize that saving money becomes far easier.
- To find your annual salary, just take your hourly rate, double it, and add three zeros to the end. If you make £20/hour, you make approximately £40,000/year. If you make £30/hour, you make approximately £60,000/year. This also works in reverse. To find your hourly rate, divide your salary by two and drop the three zeros. So £50,000/year becomes approximately £25/hour. This is based on a general forty-hour workweek and doesn’t include taxes, but it’s a good general back-of-the-napkin trick. And it’s most useful when you’re deciding whether to buy something or not. If that pair of pants is going to cost you eight hours of work, is it worth it?
- Get your paycheck, determine what you’ve been spending, and figure out what your Conscious Spending Plan should look like
- Do this now and don’t overthink it. Just break your take-home income into chunks of fixed costs (50–60 percent), long-term investments (10 percent), savings goals (5–10 percent), and guilt-free spending money (20–35 percent). How does it fit?
- Optimize your spending (two hours). Dig in deeper to your savings goals and monthly fixed costs.
- Maintain your Conscious Spending Plan
- Money exists for a reason—to let you do what you want to do. Yes, it’s true, every pound you spend now would be worth more later. But living only for tomorrow is no way to live. Consider one investment that most people overlook: yourself.
- AUTOMATING YOUR MONEY: HOW IT WORKS
- See, the only way you’d lose money on a government bond is if the government defaulted on its loans—and it doesn’t do that. If it runs low on money, it just prints more of it. Now that’s gangsta.
- Here’s what typical investors’ asset allocations—remember, that’s the mix of different investments—might look like as they get older. These figures are taken from Vanguard’s lifecycle funds.
- The Rule of 72 is a fast trick you can do to figure out how long it will take to double your money. Here’s how it works: Divide the number 72 by the return rate you’re getting, and you’ll have the number of years you must invest in order to double your money.
- THE SWENSEN MODEL OF ASSET ALLOCATION
- “Don’t let the tax tail wag the investment dog.”
- Believe that part of getting rich is giving back to the community that helped you flourish.
