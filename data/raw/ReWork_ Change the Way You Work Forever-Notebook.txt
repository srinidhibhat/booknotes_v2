REWORK: CHANGE THE WAY YOU WORK FOREVER
by Jason Fried, David Heinemeier Hansson
- Small is not just a stepping-stone. Small is a great destination in itself.
- You want to get into the rhythm of making choices. When you get in that flow of making decision after decision, you build momentum and boost morale. Decisions are progress. Each one you make is a brick in your foundation. You can’t build on top of “We’ll decide later,” but you can build on top of “Done.”
- Start getting into the habit of saying no—even to many of your best ideas. Use the power of no to get your priorities straight. You rarely regret saying no. But you often wind up regretting saying yes.
- Don’t make up problems you don’t have yet. It’s not a problem until it’s a real problem. Most of the things you worry about never happen anyway.
- You shouldn’t expect the job to be someone’s entire life—at least not if you want to keep them around for a long time.
