EXCELLENT ADVICE FOR LIVING: WISDOM I WISH I'D KNOWN EARLIER
by Kevin Kelly
- Trust me: There is no “them.”
- The urgency is a disguise for a scam.
- Following your bliss is a recipe for paralysis if you don’t know what you are passionate about. A better path for most youth is “master something.” Through mastery of one thing you’ll command a viewpoint to steadily find where your bliss is.
- Don’t reserve you kindest praise for a person until their eulogy. Tell them while they are alive when it makes a difference to them Write it in a letter they can keep.
- When you are young have friends who are older; when you are old have friends who are younger.
- The work on any worthy project is endless, infinite. You cannot limit the work so you must limit your hours. Your time, not the work is the only thing you can manage.
- If your goal does not have a schedule, it is a dream.
- Don’t ever work for someone you don’t want to become.
- The best work ethic requires a good rest ethic.
- Speak confidently as if you are right but listen carefully as if you are wrong.
- Very few regrets in life are about what you did. Almost all are about what you didn’t do.
