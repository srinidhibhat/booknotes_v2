- I’m seventeen and I’m crazy. My uncle says the two always go together.
- How rarely did other people’s faces take of you and throw back to you your own expression, your own innermost trembling thought?
- Always at night the alarm comes. Never by day! Is it because the fire is prettier by night? More spectacle, a better show?
- The most significant memory he had of Mildred, really, was of a little girl in a forest without trees (how odd!) or rather a little girl lost on a plateau where there used to be trees
- ‘There must be something in books, things we can’t imagine, to make a woman stay in a burning house; there must be something there. You don’t stay for nothing.’
- ‘The zipper displaces the button and man lacks just that much time to think while dressing at dawn, a philosophical hour, and thus a melancholy hour.’
- We cannot tell the precise moment when friendship is formed. As in filling a vessel drop by drop, there is at last a drop which makes it run over, so in a series of kindnesses there is at last one which makes the heart run over.”’
- ‘That’s the good part of dying; when you’ve got nothing to lose, you run any risk you want.’
- The things you’re looking for, Montag, are in the world, but the only way the average chap will ever see ninety-nine per cent of them is in a book.
- Do your own bit of saving, and if you drown, at least die knowing you were headed for shore.’
- ‘Those who don’t build must burn. It’s as old as history and juvenile delinquents.’ ‘So that’s what I am.’ ‘There’s some of it in all of us.’
- ‘You know the war’s on?’ ‘I heard.’ ‘God, isn’t it funny?’ said the old man. ‘It seems so remote because we have our own troubles.’
- He floated on his back when the valise filled and sank; the river was mild and leisurely, going away from the people who ate shadows for breakfast and steam for lunch and vapours for supper.
- The sun burned every day. It burned Time. The world rushed in a circle and turned on its axis and time was busy burning the years and the people anyway, without any help from him. So if he burnt things with the firemen, and the sun burnt Time, that meant that everything burned!
- All of us have photographic memories, but spend a lifetime learning how to block off the things that are really in there.
- The difference between the man who just cuts lawns and a real gardener is in the touching, he said. The lawn-cutter might just as well not have been there at all; the gardener will be there a lifetime.’
- “Stuff your eyes with wonder,” he said, “live as if you’d drop dead in ten seconds. See the world. It’s more fantastic than any dream made or paid for in factories. Ask no guarantees, ask for no security, there never was such an animal. And if there were, it would be related to the great sloth which hangs upside down in a tree all day every day, sleeping its life away. To hell with that,” he said, “shake the tree and knock the great sloth down on his ass.”’
