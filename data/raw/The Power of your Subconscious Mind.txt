The Power of your Subconscious Mind
by Dr. Joseph Murphy

- A magnetized piece of Iron will lift about twelve times its own weight. But if you demagnetize it, it will not life even a feather. Confidence and faith act like magnets. 
- Never ever give negative autosuggestions to your subconscious mind. It will take it as a request and grant it. Instead use positive autosuggestion. Several times a day - morning, noon and at night - repeat to yourself what you want to achieve. 
- When you eat a piece of bread, your subconscious mind transmutes it into tissue, muscle, bone and blood. 
- Prayer to follow: "My body and all its organs were created by the infinite intelligence in my subconscious mind. It knows how to heal me. Its wisdom fashioned all my organs, tissues, muscles and bones. This infinite healing presence within me is now transforming every cell of my being, making me whole and perfect. I give thanks for the healing I know is taking place at this time. Wonderful are the works of the creative intelligence within me."
- The organ of healing is the subconscious mind, and the process of healing is faith. 
- Any method that causes you to move from fear and worry to faith and expectancy will heal. 
- When you enter into a sleepy, drowsy state, effort is reduced to a minimum. The conscious mind is submerged to a great extent when in a sleepy state. 
- Practical techniques in mental healing:
    1. 'Thank you' technique: Say thanks to god for what you have when you are in tough situations. 
    2. Affirmative method: Maintain attitude of mind as true. affirm good to be true. 
    3. Argumentative method: Argue in courtroom of your mind. Render a verdict in favour of what you want. 
- Scientists say that you build a new body every eleven months; so from a physical standpoint you are really only eleven months old. If you build defects back into your body by thoughts of fear, anger, jealousy and ill will, you have no one to blame but yourself. 
- Anytime you try to force your subconscious mind to do something for you, you will fail. It does not respond to mental coercion. It responds to your faith. 
- When your desires and imagination are in conflict, your imagination invariably gains the day. 
- Suppose you were asked to walk the length of the plank that was resting on the floor, you would do it easily. But now suppose the same plank was 20 feet up, stretching between two walls, would you walk it? Could you? 
- Do not ever regard money as evil or filthy. If you do, you cause it to fly away from you. Remember that you lose what you condemn. You cannot attract what you criticize. 
- When you sleep, you become asleep to the world of the senses and alive to the wisdom and power of your subconscious mind. 
- The best time to prevent divorce is before marriage. 
- Life holds no grudge on you. Life never condemns you. Life heals a cut on your hand. Life forgives you if you burn your finger. It reduces the edema and restores the past to wholeness and perfection.
- You are as strong as you think you are. 
    You are as young as you think you are. 
    You are as useful as you think you are. 
    You are as young as your thoughts.
    You are a child of the infinite life that knows no end you are an heir to eternity. 
    You are Wonderful!
