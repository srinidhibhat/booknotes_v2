THE BODY KEEPS THE SCORE: MIND, BRAIN AND BODY IN THE TRANSFORMATION OF TRAUMA
by Bessel van der Kolk
- “The greatest sources of our suffering are the lies we tell ourselves.”
- If you do something to a patient that you would not do to your friends or children, consider whether you are unwittingly replicating a trauma from the patient’s past.
- Remember asking him once: “What would you call this patient—schizophrenic or schizoaffective?” He paused and stroked his chin, apparently in deep thought. “I think I’d call him Michael McIntyre,” he replied.
- Our capacity to destroy one another is matched by our capacity to heal one another.
- Medications, drugs, and alcohol can also temporarily dull or obliterate unbearable sensations and feelings. But the body continues to keep the score.
- Prior to the advent of brain, there was no color and no sound in the universe, nor was there any flavor or aroma and probably little sense and no feeling or emotion. Before brains the universe was also free of pain and anxiety. —Roger Sperry
- Breathing, eating, sleeping, pooping, and peeing are so fundamental that their significance is easily neglected when we’re considering the complexities of mind and behavior.
- Our self-experience is the product of the balance between our rational and our emotional brains. When these two systems are in balance, we “feel like ourselves.”
- Being anchored in the present while revisiting the trauma opens the possibility of deeply knowing that the terrible events belong to the past.
- When you can’t be fully here, you go to the places where you did feel alive—even if those places are filled with horror and misery.
- If you cannot feel satisfaction in ordinary everyday things like taking a walk, cooking a meal, or playing with your kids, life will pass you by.
- Our culture teaches us to focus on personal uniqueness, but at a deeper level we barely exist as individual organisms. Our brains are built to help us function as members of a tribe. We are part of that tribe even when we are by ourselves, whether listening to music (that other people created), watching a basketball game on television (our own muscles tensing as the players run and jump), or preparing a spreadsheet for a sales meeting (anticipating the boss’s reactions). Most of our energy is devoted to connecting with others.
- The brain is a cultural organ—experience shapes the brain.
- What is your brain doing when you have nothing in particular on your mind? It turns out that you pay attention to yourself: The default state activates the brain areas that work together to create your sense of “self.”
- “What cannot be communicated to the [m]other cannot be communicated to the self.”
- Truth, like love and sleep, resents Approaches that are too intense.
- Her immune system, her muscles, and her fear system all had kept the score, but her conscious mind lacked a story that could communicate the experience. She reenacted her trauma in her life, but she had no narrative to refer to.
- I gradually came to realize that the only thing that makes it possible to do the work of healing trauma is awe at the dedication to survival that enabled my patients to endure their abuse and then to endure the dark nights of the soul that inevitably occur on the road to recovery.
- Understanding what is “wrong” with people currently is more a question of the mind-set of the practitioner (and of what insurance companies will pay for) than of verifiable, objective facts.
- Traumatized people simultaneously remember too little and too much.
- The mind cannot help but make meaning out of what it knows, and the meaning we make of our lives changes how and what we remember.
- “Who can find a proper grave for such damaged mosaics of the mind, where they may rest in pieces? Life goes on, but in two temporal directions at once, the future unable to escape the grip of a memory laden with grief.”31
- We are a hopeful species. Working with trauma is as much about remembering how we survived as it is about what is broken.
- The moment you see a group of grim-faced people break out in a giggle, you know that the spell of misery has broken.
- Being traumatized is not just an issue of being stuck in the past; it is just as much a problem of not being fully alive in the present.
- If you’ve been hurt, you need to acknowledge and name what happened to you.
- Communicating fully is the opposite of being traumatized.
- Trauma makes people feel like either some body else, or like no body. In order to overcome trauma, you need help to get back in touch with your body, with your Self.
- This way of reassembling old information into new packages may be just the way we integrate ordinary, nontraumatic day-to-day experiences.
- This week I tried doing yoga at home and the words came to me ‘Your body has things to say.’ I said back to myself, ‘I will try and listen.’”
- The two most important phrases in therapy, as in yoga, are “Notice that” and “What happens next?” Once you start approaching your body with curiosity rather than with fear, everything shifts.
- If we notice our breath we are in the present because we can’t breathe in the future or the past.
- It made me think that if I notice without being so afraid, it will be easier for me to believe myself.”
- A man has as many social selves as there are individuals who recognize him.
- How well we get along with ourselves depends largely on our internal leadership skills—how well we listen to our different parts, make sure they feel taken care of, and keep them from sabotaging one another.
- One day he told me that he’d spent his adulthood trying to let go of his past, and he remarked how ironic it was that he had to get closer to it in order to let it go.
- Every life is difficult in its own way.
- The faculty of voluntarily bringing back a wandering attention, over and over again, is the very root of the judgment, character, and will. —William James
- “You cannot help, fix, or save the young people you are working with. What you can do is work side by side with them, help them to understand their vision, and realize it with them. By doing that you give them back control. We’re healing trauma without anyone ever mentioning the word.”
- Since 2001 far more Americans have died at the hands of their partners or other family members than in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
- In today’s world your ZIP code, even more than your genetic code, determines whether you will lead a safe and healthy life.
- Poverty, unemployment, inferior schools, social isolation, widespread availability of guns, and substandard housing all are breeding grounds for trauma. Trauma breeds further trauma; hurt people hurt other people.
- Resilience is the product of agency: knowing that what you do can make a difference.
