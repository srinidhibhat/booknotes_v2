HOW TO WIN FRIENDS AND INFLUENCE PEOPLE
by Dale Carnegie
- “Don’t criticize them; they are just what we would be under similar circumstances.”
- “Don’t complain about the snow on your neighbour’s roof,” said Confucius, “when your own doorstep is unclean.”
- When dealing with people, let us remember we are not dealing with creatures of logic. We are dealing with creatures of emotion, creatures bristling with prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity.
- Any fool can criticize, condemn and complain – and most fools do. But it takes character and self-control to be understanding and forgiving.
- As Dr. Johnson said: “God himself, sir, does not propose to judge man until the end of his days.” Why should you and I?
- PRINCIPLE 1 Don’t criticize, condemn of complain.
- Lincoln once began a letter saying: “Everybody likes a compliment.” William James said: “The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated.”
- “There is nothing else that so kills the ambitions of a person as criticisms from superiors. I never criticize anyone. I believe in giving a person incentive to work. So I am anxious to praise but loath to find fault. If I like anything, I am hearty in my approbation and lavish in my praise.”
- People who would think they had committed a crime if they let their families or employees go for six days without food; but they will let them go for six days, and six weeks, and sometimes sixty years without giving them the hearty appreciation that they crave almost as much as they crave food.
- The difference between appreciation and flattery? That is simple. One is sincere and the other insincere. One comes from the heart out; the other from the teeth out. One is unselfish; the other selfish. One is universally admired; the other universally condemned.
- “Flattery is telling the other person precisely what he thinks about himself.”
- If all we had to do was flatter, everybody would catch on and we should all be experts in human relations.
- “I shall pass this way but once; any good, therefore, that I can do or any kindness that I can show to any human being, let me do it now. Let me not defer nor neglect it, for I shall not pass this way again.”
- PRINCIPLE 2 Give honest and sincere appreciation.
- “If there is any one secret of success, it lies in the ability to get the other person’s point of view and see things from that person’s angle as well as from your own.”
- PRINCIPLE 3 Arouse in the other person an eager want.
- You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you.
- If we want to make friends, let’s greet people with animation and enthusiasm. When somebody calls you on the telephone use the same psychology. Say “Hello” in tones that bespeak how pleased YOU are to have the person call.
- PRINCIPLE 1 Become genuinely interested in other people.
- You must have a good time meeting people if you expect them to have a good time meeting you.
- You don’t feel like smiling? Then what? Two things. First, force yourself to smile. If you are alone, force yourself to whistle or hum a tune or sing. Act as if you were already happy, and that will tend to make you happy.
- It isn’t what you have or who you are or where you are or what you are doing that makes you happy or unhappy. It is what you think about it.
- PRINCIPLE 2 Smile.
- PRINCIPLE 3 Remember that a person’s name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language.
- “There is no mystery about successful business intercourse… . Exclusive attention to the person who is speaking to you is very important. Nothing else is so flattering as that.”
- “Many persons call a doctor when all they want is an audience.”
- Lincoln hadn’t wanted advice. He had wanted merely a friendly, sympathetic listener to whom he could unburden himself. That’s what we all want when we are in trouble.
- So if you aspire to be a good conversationalist, be an attentive listener. To be interesting, be interested. Ask questions that other persons will enjoy answering. Encourage them to talk about themselves and their accomplishments.
- A person’s toothache means more to that person than a famine in China which kills a million people.
- PRINCIPLE 4 Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.
- PRINCIPLE 5 Talk in terms of the other person’s interests.
- If we are so contemptibly selfish that we can’t radiate a little happiness and pass on a bit of honest appreciation without trying to get something out of the other person in return – if our souls are no bigger than sour crab apples, we shall meet with the failure we so richly deserve.
- This lady, left all alone in a big house with her paisley shawls, her French antiques, and her memories, was starving for a little recognition. She had once been young and beautiful and sought after. She had once built a house warm with love and had collected things from all over Europe to make it beautiful. Now, in the isolated loneliness of old age, she craved a little human warmth, a little genuine appreciation – and no one gave it to her. And when she found it, like a spring in the desert, her gratitude couldn’t adequately express itself with anything less than the gift of her cherished Packard.
- “Talk to people about themselves and they will listen for hours.”
- PRINCIPLE 6 Make the other person feel important – and do it sincerely.
- There is only one way under high heaven to get the best of an argument – and that is to avoid it.
- Here lies the body of William Jay, Who died maintaining his right of way – He was right, dead right, as he sped along, But he’s just as dead as if he were wrong.
- “Hatred is never ended by hatred but by love,”
- Anyone who takes the time to disagree with you is interested in the same things you are. Think of them as people who really want to help you, and you may turn your opponents into friends.
- When one yells, the other should listen – because when two people yell, there is no communication, just noise and bad vibrations.”
- PRINCIPLE 1 The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it.
- “Be wiser than other people if you can; but do not tell them so.”
- There’s magic, positive magic, in such phrases as: “I may be wrong. I frequently am. Let’s examine the facts.”
- You will never get into trouble by admitting that you may be wrong. That will stop all argument and inspire your opponent to be just as fair and open and broad-minded as you are. It will make him want to admit that he, too, may be wrong.
- “I judge people by their own principles – not by my own.”
- PRINCIPLE 2 Show respect for the other person’s opinions. Never say, “You’re wrong.”
- Any fool can try to defend his or her mistakes – and most fools do – but it raises one above the herd and gives one a feeling of nobility and exultation to admit one’s mistakes.
- PRINCIPLE 3 If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically.
- PRINCIPLE 4 Begin in a friendly way.
- PRINCIPLE 5 Get the other person saying “yes, yes” immediately.
- “If you want enemies, excel your friends; but if you want friends, let your friends excel you.”
- PRINCIPLE 6 Let the other person do a great deal of the talking.
- PRINCIPLE 7 Let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers.
- Success in dealing with people depends on a sympathetic grasp of the other person’s viewpoint.”
- PRINCIPLE 8 Try honestly to see things from the other person’s point of view.
- Three-fourths of the people you will ever meet are hungering and thirsting for sympathy. Give it to them, and they will love you.
- “Sympathy the human species universally craves. The child eagerly displays his injury; or even inflicts a cut or bruise in order to reap abundant sympathy. For the same purpose adults show their bruises, relate their accidents, illness, especially details of surgical operations. ‘Self-pity’ for misfortunes real or imaginary is in some measure, practically a universal practice.”
- PRINCIPLE 9 Be sympathetic with the other person’s ideas and desires.
- PRINCIPLE 10 Appeal to the nobler motives.
- PRINCIPLE 11 Dramatize your ideas.
- “The way to get things done,” say Schwab, “is to stimulate competition. I do not mean in a sordid, money-getting way, but in the desire to excel.”
- PRINCIPLE 12 Throw down a challenge.
- PRINCIPLE 1 Begin with praise and honest appreciation.
- PRINCIPLE 2 Call attention to people’s mistakes indirectly.
- PRINCIPLE 3 Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person.
- People are more likely to accept an order if they have had a part in the decision that caused the order to be issued.
- PRINCIPLE 4 Ask questions instead of giving direct orders.
- PRINCIPLE 5 Let the other person save face.
- “Praise is like sunlight to the warm human spirit; we cannot flower and grow without it. And yet, while most of us are only too ready to apply to others the cold wind of criticism, we are somehow reluctant to give our fellow the warm sunshine of praise.”
- The principles taught in this book will work only when they come from the heart. I am not advocating a bag of tricks. I am talking about a new way of life.
- PRINCIPLE 6 Praise the slightest improvement and praise every improvement. Be “hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise.”
- PRINCIPLE 7 Give the other person a fine reputation to live up
- PRINCIPLE 8 Use encouragement. Make the fault seem easy to correct.
- PRINCIPLE 9 Make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest.
