CRIME AND PUNISHMENT
by Fyodor Dostoyevsky
- “Hm... yes, all is in a man’s hands and he lets it all slip from cowardice, that’s an axiom. It would be interesting to know what it is men are most afraid of. Taking a new step, uttering a new word is what they fear most.... But I am talking too much. It’s because I chatter that I do nothing. Or perhaps it is that I chatter because I do nothing.
- That’s why I drink too. I try to find sympathy and feeling in drink.... I drink so that I may suffer twice as much!”
- He was interested by the question why in all great towns men are not simply driven by necessity, but in some peculiar way inclined to live in those parts of the town where there are no gardens nor fountains; where there is most dirt and smell and all sorts of nastiness.
- I only say he is a nice man in his own way! But if one looks at men in all ways—are there many good ones left?
- Science now tells us, love yourself before all men, for everything in the world rests on self-interest. You love yourself and manage your own affairs properly and your coat remains whole. Economic truth adds that the better private affairs are organised in society—the more whole coats, so to say—the firmer are its foundations and the better is the common welfare organised too. Therefore, in acquiring wealth solely and exclusively for myself, I am acquiring, so to speak, for all, and helping to bring to pass my neighbour’s getting a little more than a torn coat; and that not from private, personal liberality, but as a consequence of the general advance.
- Strength, strength is what one wants, you can get nothing without it, and strength must be won by strength—that’s what they don’t know,”
- To go wrong in one’s own way is better than to go right in someone else’s. In the first case you are a man, in the second you’re no better than a bird.
- In face she resembled her brother, but she might be described as really beautiful.
- Although Pulcheria Alexandrovna was forty-three, her face still retained traces of her former beauty; she looked much younger than her age, indeed, which is almost always the case with women who retain serenity of spirit, sensitiveness and pure sincere warmth of heart to old age.
- In wine is truth, and the truth had all come out, “that is, all the uncleanness of his coarse and envious heart”!
- “I have been meaning to buy a lock for these two years. People are happy who have no need of locks,”
- “It’s the moon that makes it so still, weaving some mystery,”
- I kept asking myself then: why am I so stupid that if others are stupid—and I know they are—yet I won’t be wiser?
- With all Avdotya Romanovna’s natural aversion and in spite of my invariably gloomy and repellent aspect—she did at least feel pity for me, pity for a lost soul. And if once a girl’s heart is moved to pity, it’s more dangerous than anything.
- Nothing in the world is harder than speaking the truth and nothing easier than flattery. If there’s the hundredth part of a false note in speaking the truth, it leads to a discord, and that leads to trouble. But if all, to the last note, is false in flattery, it is just as agreeable, and is heard not without satisfaction. It may be a coarse satisfaction, but still a satisfaction. And however coarse the flattery, at least half will be sure to seem true.
- You mustn’t spoil me, Rodya, you know; come when you can, but if you can’t, it doesn’t matter, I can wait. I shall know, anyway, that you are fond of me, that will be enough for me.
- “Dounia darling, if I am guilty forgive me (though I cannot be forgiven if I am guilty).
- “But why are they so fond of me if I don’t deserve it? Oh, if only I were alone and no one loved me and I too had never loved anyone! Nothing of all this would have happened.
- There’s a peasant woman with a baby, begging. It’s curious that she thinks me happier than she is.
