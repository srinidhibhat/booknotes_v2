Quiet
by Susan Cain

- Introverts living under the extrovert ideal are like women in a mans world.
- People who passes on the street can't know that we are clever and charming unless we look it.
- Old ads: short and crisp, just a tag line about product.
- New ads: personality driven. Ex: A soap ad says,that all around you people are just judging you silently and only the advertiser's product will rescue you. 
- Social media has made new forms of leadership possible for scores of people who don't fit the Harvard Business School mold. (Author speaking about Numark - an introvert who is the founder of Craigslist, most famous website for connecting people).
- If you're in the backyard sitting under a tree while everyone else is clinking glasses on the patio, you're more likely to have an apple fall on your head.
- Many studies prove that people can do much work and think creatively and clearly, individually than in group. Though some amount of group interaction is essential. Hence a well-balanced mix of these two is the ideal environment to work.
- Human beings seek 'just right' levels of simulation - not too much (over arousal) and not too little (under arousal). Extroverts prefer more stimulation from outside world whereas introverts enjoy shutting the doors of their rooms, because for them quiet activity is optimally stimulating. 
- Over arousal - you've had enough and would like to go home. Under arousal - not enough is happening; you feel itchy, restless, like you need to get out of the house already.
- Set some comfortable sweet spots where you can work efficiently. (Sweet spots are the optimal levels of arousal).
- There is no one more courageous than the person who speaks with the courage of his conviction.
- Extroverts see "What is?". Introvert thinks "What if?".
- Extroverts are reward sensitive. They feel a buzz of excitement. So they do things without thinking. But introverts are very careful at each time.
- Success in investing doesn't correlate with IQ. Once tou have ordinary intelligence, what you need is the temperament to control the urges that get other people into trouble in investing. - Warren Buffet.
- In a gentle way, you can shake the world. - Mahatma Gandhi.
- Conviction is conviction, at whatever decibel level it is expressed.
- Acting like an extrovert (pseudo extroverts) works fine for a short period of time - accomplish a certain task. But believing that you have to be the person you are not for the entire lifetime is dangerous. The first one is called self-monitoring. Latter - Self negation.
- 3 key steps to identifying your own core personal projects:
    1. Think back to what you loved to do when you were child. The answer may have been off the mark, but the underlying impulse was not. 
    2. Pay attention to the work you gravitate to.
    3. Pay attention to what you envy. Zometimes you envy that person because you want to be that person.
- Restorative niche - The place you will go when you want to return to your true self. Create as many restorative niches as possible in daily life.
- A Free Trait Agreement acknowledges that we'll act each out of character some of the time - in exchange for being yourself the rest of the time.
- The degree of extroversion seems to influence how many friends you have, but not how good a friend you are.
- Introverts like people they meet in friendly contexts. Extroverts prefer those they compete with.
- Introverts be like: "If I am in a room with 10 people and I have a choice between talking and not talking, I am the one not talking." And people ask "Why aren't you saying anything?". "Because, I am the guy they are saying it to."
- An introvert salesman: "I discovered early on that people don't buy from me because they understand what I am selling. They buy because they feel understood."
- Where we stumble is where our treasure lies.
- The secret of life is to put yourself in the right lighting. For some, it's a Broadway spotlight; for others, a lamplit desk.
