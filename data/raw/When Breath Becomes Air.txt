When Breath Becomes Air
by Paul Kalanithi

- After I was caught returning at dawn from a late-night escapade, my worried mother thoroughly interrogated me very drug teenagers take, never suspecting that the most intoxicating thing I'd experienced, by far, was the volume of romantic poetry she'd handed me the previous week. Books became my closest confidants, finely grounded lenses providing new views of the world. 
- If the unexamined life was not worth living, was the unlived life worth examining?
- Brains give rise to our ability to form relationships and make life meaningful. Sometimes, they break.
- Seeing the body as matter and mechanism is the flip side to easing the most profound human suffering. 
- The neatness of medical diagrams did nothing to represent Nature, red not only in tooth and claw but in birth as well.
- "With one of the ER residents covering for me, I slipped back in, ghostlike, to save the icecream sandwich in front of the corpse of the son I could not."
- One of the early meaning of patient is "one who endures hardship without complaint."
- Death, so familiar to me in my work, was now paying a personal visit.
- People often ask if it (Neurosurgery) is a calling, and my answer is always yes. You can't see it as a job, because if it's a job, it's one of the worst jobs there is. 
- Dying in one's fourth decade is unusual, but *dying* is not.
- One of Paul's experience:
	Another day, I placed an electrode nine centimeters deep in a patient's brain to treat a Parkinson's tremor. The target was the subthalamic nucleus. Different parts of it subserve different functions: movement, cognition, emotion. In the operating room, we turned on the current to assess the tremor. With all our eyes on the patent's left hand, we agreed the tremor looked better. 
	Then the patient's voice, confused, rose above our affirmative murmurs: "I feel... overwhelmingly sad."
	"Current off!" I said.
	"Oh now the feeling is going away," the patient said.
	"Let's recheck the current and impedance, okay? Okay. Current on.."
	"No everything.. it just feels.. so sad. Just dark and, and sad."
	"Electrode out!"
	We pulled the electrode out and reinserted it, this time two millimeters to the right. The tremor went away. That patient felt, thankfully, fine.
- What happened to Paul was tragic, but he was not a tragedy.
- Paul's message to his daughter Cady:
	When you come to any of the moments in life where you must give an account of yourself, provide a ledger of what you have been, and done, and meant to the world, do not, I pray, discount that you filled a dying man's days with a sated joy, a joy unknown to me in all my prior years, a joy that does not hunger for more and more but rests, satisfied. In this time, right now, that is an enormous thing.
-  Paul Sudhir Arul Kalanithi was born on April 1 1977, India-American neurosurgeon and writer, had BA and MA in English literature and a BA in human Biology (also MPhil, graduated cum laude). He died in 2015, after 22 months he had been diagnosed with metastatic lung cancer.
- "I can't go on, I'll go on."
