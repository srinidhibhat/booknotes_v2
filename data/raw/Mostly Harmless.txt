Mostly Harmless 
by Douglas Adams 

- Nothing travels faster than speed of light with the possible exception of bad news, which obeys its own special laws. 
- Everybody has their moment of great opportunity in life. If you happen to miss the one you care about, then everything else in life becomes eerily easy.
- Being virtually killed by a virtual laser in virtual space is just as effective as the real thing, because you are as dead as you think you are. 
- The quality of any advice anybody has to offer has to be judged against the quality of life they actually lead. 
- Another, unexpected result was a dramatic lowering of the suicide rate. All sorts of stressed and rising executives who had been forced, during the dark days of the Breathe-O-Smart tyranny, to jump in front of trains or stab themselves, could now just clamber out on to their own window ledges and leap off at their leisure. What frequently happened, though, was that in the moment or two they had to look around and gather their thoughts they would suddenly discover that all they had really needed was a breath of air and a fresh perspective on things, and maybe also a farm on which they could keep a few sheep.
