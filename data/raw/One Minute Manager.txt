One Minute Manager 
by Ken Blanchard and Spencer Johnson

- Set One minute goals: Agree on your goals, write out each of your goals on a single sheet of paper using less than 250 words. Tead and re-read each goal. Take a minute every once in a while to look at your goals and see whether it matches your performance.
- One minute praisings: Catch someone when they are doing something right and praise them. Make physical contact - shake hands, pat on the shoulder to support their success. Encourage them to do more.
- One minute reprimand: Tell people what they did wrong. Stop for a few seconds of silence. Let them know you are on their side. Reaffirm that you think well of them but not of their performance in this situation.
