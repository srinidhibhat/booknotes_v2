Elon Musk
by Ashlee Vance

- One thing that Musk holds in the highest regard is resolve, and he respects people who continue on after being told no.
- Buy a Tesla. Forget about the mess you've made of the planet for a while.
- The best minds of our generation are thinking about how to make people click ads. That sucks!
- Innovation is a finite resource. The probability of us discovering another top-one-hundred-type invention gets smaller and smaller.
- Where Mark Zuckerberg wants to help you share baby photos, Musk what to save the human race from self-imposed or accidental annihilation.
- Musk was Born in 1971 (Africa, Johannesburg) to Maye and Errol Musk. Musk siblings - Kimbal, Tosca.
- Elon's parents divorced early. He stayed with his father, then moved to Canada in search of good college. He had a difficult childhood in school because of some bullies. He did all kinds of jobs (vegetable vendor etc.,) in Canada and then made his way through college. He was a romantic guy always in search of girls. In college itself he had ideas for solar, space and electric cars.
- Musk brothers (Elon and Kimbal) then bought a BMW 320i and rode to USA. They both started their first startup - zip2 (Yellow pages like listing online for hotels, pizza parlors etc).
- After the success of zip2, "Compaq computers" bought the company for $307 Million. Musk and Kimbal got $22 million and $15 million respectively. Then he left the company for a new project.
- In March 1999, Musk incorporated "X.com", a financial startup with his $22 million (He even bought a McLaren). In March 2000, "X.com" merged with a similar startup - PayPal. (Then the CEO of PayPal - Peter Thiel - took over as CEO of the merged company).
- Musk was seriously ill once he took a vacation to Africa. He took 6 months to recover. It was a near death experience for him. 
- In June 2002, Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) near El Segundo of Los Angeles.
- PayPal was bought by eBay for $1.5 billion in July 2002. Musk got $250 million ($180 mil after taxes). During that time, he lost his son Nevada. At that time Justine was his wife.
- Musk decided to launch Falcon 1 rocket. After numerous setbacks, on March 24 2006, Falcon 1's first launch attempt happened and failed (due to corrosion of b-rust).
- Then again on March 21 2007, Falcon 1 was launched. For more than 5 minutes it behaved properly. But it flamed out eventually leading to another failure. But Musk was unshakeable.
- In the fall of 2003, Straubel - an Electric car buff - met Musk and shared his idea of electric car. Musk gave $10,000 to him. Meanwhile two guys named Eberhard and Tarpenning wanted to start a company called Tesla Motors. Musk funded $5 million into the company, becoming the largest shareholder and chairman of Tesla. Later Straubel joined the company.
- On May 2006, the team built a black version of Roadster known as EP1. Musk again put $12 million and many other investors (Larry Page, Sergey Brin etc.,) joined $40 million investment round. On July 2006, they built a red prototype. Many people pre-booked a Tesla car for $100,000, but due to many setbacks Tesla failed to deliver the product on time. Later Eberhard, Tarpenning and other major workers left the company.
- On June 16 2008, Musk filed for divorce. Justine, Musk's wife wrote on her blog: "There's no such thing as a well-adjusted public figure. If they were well-adjusted, they wouldn't try to be a public figure."
- Elon went to London to free his mind with his friend Lee. There he met a model Talulah Riley. He liked her, proposed her and brought her to US.
- On August 2 2008, SpaceX launched Falcon 9 with a cargo of 375 pounds. It failed again on separation during 2nd stage. Elon said to his employees: "Look, we are going to do this. it's going to be okay. Don't freak out."
- On September 28 2008, the fourth and possibly final launch (if failed) took place with a 360 pound dummy payload (no company or military trusted SpaceX with their cargo) and more it was a success. It took six years (4 and a half years more than Musk planned) and 500 people to make this miracle happen.
- At the end of 2008, Musk ran out of money (due to failures of Tesla and SpaceX).
- On December 23 2008. SpaceX received $1.6 Billion as payment for 12 flights to the space station. It was a lifeline for Elon, SpaceX and Tesla.
- 2008 was hardest for Elon. If it was anyone other than Musk, he wouldn't have survived.
- Then comes Falcon 9. Another gigantic rocket which resulted in huge success. Where the Falcon 1 blasting off from Kwajalein was the work of a startup. The Falcon 9 taking off from Vandenberg is the work of an aerospace superpower.
- SpaceX then started to send a rocket up about once a month, becoming one of the most consistent operators.
- Zip2, PayPal, Tesla, SolarCity - they are all expressions of Musk. SpaceX is Musk.
- In December 2010, SpaceX got the Dragon capsule to orbit Earth and return successfully.
- It took until nearly 2009 for Tesla to really hit its stride with the Roadster. He hiked the price of the car from $92,000 to $109,000.
- It had some issues (the Roadster), but Elon found it as a way to impress his customers with extraordinary customer service.
- Eberhard in June 2009, sued Musk for his ousting from the company. After a while all was settled. Both still resent each other, but Eberhard still drives his Roadster, and his wife got a Model S.
- From 2008 to 2012, Tesla sold about 2,500 Roadsters. His main objective was to prove that electric cars were fun to ride and that they could be objects of desire. That came true.
- On March 2009, Tesla Model S was unveiled in a press event.
- By the middle of February 2013, Tesla has fallen into crisis state. Then in April, Musk talked to Larry Page and he agreed for $6 Billion acquisition deal. But then miracle happened. A huge volume of cars were sold and on May 8 2013, Tesla posted its first ever profit - $11 Million. Google deal was cancelled.
- The Rive brothers (Lyndon, Peter and Russ) who were cousins of Musk formed a company called SolarCity in 2006 in which Musk invested and became the company's chairman and its largest shareholder (owning about a third of SolarCity).
- In August 2013, Musk unveiled Hyperloop.
- Many say Elon is a mix of Steve Jobs and Bill Gates.
- Musk married, divorced, remarried and then divorced the actress Talulah Riley.
- Musk - "I would like to dies on Mars, just not on impact. Ideally I'd like to go for a visit, come back for a while, and then go there when I'm like seventy or something and then just stay there. If things turn out well, that would be the case. If my wife and I have a bunch of kids, she would probably stay with them on Earth."
