Four Thousand Weeks
by Oliver Burkeman 

- None of us can single-handedly overthrow society dedicated to limitless productivity, distraction and speed. But right here, right now, you can stop buying into the delusion that any of that is ever going to bring satisfaction. You can face the facts. You can turn on the shower, brace yourself for some invigoratingly icy water, and step in.
- Rendering yourself more efficient - either by implementing various productivity techniques or by driving yourself harder â€“ won't generally result in the feeling of having 'enough time', because, all else being equal, the demands will increase to offset any benefits. Far from getting things done, you'll be creating new things to do.
- Once you stop believing that it might somehow be possible to avoid hard choices about time, it gets easier to make better ones. You begin to grasp that when there's too much to do, and there always will be, the only route to psychological freedom is to let go of the limit-denying fantasy of getting it all done and instead to focus on doing a few things that count.
- What's required is the will to resist the urge to consume more and more experiences, since that strategy can only lead to the feeling of having even more experiences left to consume. Once you truly understand that you're guaranteed to miss out on almost every experience the world has to offer, the fact that there are so many you still haven't experienced stops feeling like a problem. Instead, you get to focus on fully enjoying the tiny slice of experiences you actually do have time for - and the freer you are too choose, in each moment, what counts the most. 
- Because children grow up, we think a child's purpose is to grow up, but a child's purpose is to be a child. Nature doesn't disdain what only lives for a day. It pours the whole of itself into each moment. Life's bounty is in its flow. Later is too late.
- Once you give up on the unattainable goal of eradicating all your problems, it becomes possible to develop an appreciation for the fact that life just is a process of engaging with problem after problem, giving each one the time it requires - that the presence of problems in your life, in other words, isn't an impediment to a meaningful existence but the very substance of one.
- People in long-term unemployment get a happiness boost when the weekend arrives, just like employed people relaxing after a busy workweek, though they don't have a workweek in the first place. The reason is that part of what makes weekends fun is getting to spend time with others who are also off work - plus, for the unemployed, the weekend offers respite from feelings of shame that they ought to be working when they aren't.
- What you do with your life doesn't matter all that much - and when it comes to how you're using your finite time, the universe absolutely could not care less.
- Once you no longer need to convince yourself that the world isn't filled with uncertainty and tragedy, you're free to focus on doing what you can to help. And once you no longer need to convince yourself that you'll do everything that needs doing, you're free to focus on doing a few things that count.
