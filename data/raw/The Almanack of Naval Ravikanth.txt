The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness 
by Eric Jorgenson
=====================
- If you have nothing in your life, but you have at least one person that loves you unconditionally, it’ll do wonders for your self-esteem.
- You should not grind at a lot of hard work until you figure out what you should be working on.
- You’re not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity — a piece of a business — to gain your financial freedom.
- Set and enforce an aspirational personal hourly rate. If fixing a problem will save less than your hourly rate, ignore it. If outsourcing a task will cost less than your hourly rate, outsource it.
- Technology democratizes consumption but consolidates production. The best person in the world at anything gets to do it for everyone.
- The specific knowledge is sort of this weird combination of unique traits from your DNA, your unique upbringing, and your response to it. It’s almost baked into your personality and your identity. Then you can hone it.
- Society, business, & money are downstream of technology, which is itself downstream of science. Science applied is the engine of humanity.
- The internet has massively broadened the possible space of careers. Most people haven’t figured this out yet.
- Play Long-Term Games with Long-Term People
- Intentions don’t matter. Actions do. That’s why being ethical is hard.
- When you find the right thing to do, when you find the right people to work with, invest deeply. Sticking with it for decades is really how you make the big returns in your relationships and in your money. So, compound interest is very important.
- We live in an age of infinite leverage, and the economic rewards for genuine intellectual curiosity have never been higher. [11] Following your genuine intellectual curiosity is a better foundation for a career than following whatever is making money right now.
- I think the meaning of life is to do things for their own sake.
- The less you want something, the less you’re thinking about it, the less you’re obsessing over it, the more you’re going to do it in a natural way. The more you’re going to do it for yourself. You’re going to do it in a way you’re good at, and you’re going to stick with it. The people around you will see the quality of your work is higher.
- Code is probably the most powerful form of permissionless leverage. All you need is a computer—you don’t need anyone’s permission.
- Whenever you can in life, optimize for independence rather than pay. If you have independence and you’re accountable on your output, as opposed to your input—that’s the dream.
- What you want in life is to be in control of your time. You want to get into a leveraged job where you control your own time and you’re tracked on the outputs. If you do something incredible to move the needle on the business, they have to pay you. Especially if they don’t know how you did it because it’s innate to your obsession or your skill or your innate abilities, they’re going to have to keep paying you to do it.
- If you want to be part of a great tech company, then you need to be able to SELL or BUILD. If you don’t do either, learn.
- Earn with your mind, not your time.
- I would love to be paid purely for my judgment, not for any work. I want a robot, capital, or computer to do the work, but I want to be paid for my judgment.
- We waste our time with short-term thinking and busywork. Warren Buffett spends a year deciding and a day acting. That act lasts decades.
- Value your time at an hourly rate, and ruthlessly spend to save time at that rate. You will never be worth more than you think you’re worth.
- Spend more time making the big decisions. There are basically three really big decisions you make in your early life: where you live, who you’re with, and what you do.
- There are almost 7 billion people on this planet. Someday, I hope, there will be almost 7 billion companies.
- Retirement is when you stop sacrificing today for an imaginary tomorrow. When today is complete, in and of itself, you’re retired.
- Whether in commerce, science, or politics — history remembers the artists.
- Art is creativity. Art is anything done for its own sake. What are the things that are done for their own sake, and there’s nothing behind them? Loving somebody, creating something, playing.
- Lusting for money is bad for us because it is a bottomless pit. It will always occupy your mind. If you love money, and you make it, there’s never enough. There is never enough because the desire is turned on and doesn’t turn off at some number. It’s a fallacy to think it turns off at some number.
- I think the best way to stay away from this constant love of money is to not upgrade your lifestyle as you make money.
- To the extent money buys freedom, it’s great. But to the extent it makes me less free, which it definitely does at some level as well, I don’t like it.
- Ways to get lucky: 
    - Hope luck finds you. 
    - Hustle until you stumble into it. 
    - Prepare the mind and be sensitive to chances others miss. 
    - Become the best at what you do. 
    Refine what you do until this is true. Opportunity will seek you out. Luck becomes your destiny.
- I believe deep down we all know who we are. You cannot hide anything from yourself. Your own failures are written within your psyche, and they are obvious to you. If you have too many of these moral shortcomings, you will not respect yourself. The worst outcome in this world is not having self-esteem. If you don’t love yourself, who will?
- It takes time — even once you have all of these pieces in place, there is an indeterminate amount of time you have to put in. If you’re counting, you’ll run out of patience before success actually arrives.
- Your real résumé is just a catalog of all your suffering.
- Money buys you freedom in the material world. It’s not going to make you happy, it’s not going to solve your health problems, it’s not going to make your family great, it’s not going to make you fit, it’s not going to make you calm. But it will solve a lot of external problems. It’s a reasonable step to go ahead and make money.
- If you want to make the maximum amount of money possible, if you want to get rich over your life in a deterministically predictable way, stay on the bleeding edge of trends and study technology, design, and art — become really good at something.
- You don’t get rich by spending your time to save money. You get rich by saving your time to make money.
- If you can’t rederive concepts from the basics as you need them, you’re lost. You’re just memorizing.
- The moment of suffering — when you’re in pain — is a moment of truth. It is a moment where you’re forced to embrace reality the way it actually is. Then, you can make meaningful change and progress. You can only make progress when you’re starting with the truth.
- What we wish to be true clouds our perception of what is true. Suffering is the moment when we can no longer deny reality.
- Imagine we’re going through something difficult like a breakup, a job loss, a business failure, or a health problem, and our friends are advising us. When we’re advising them, the answer is obvious. It comes to us in a minute, and we tell them exactly, “Oh that girl, get over her, she wasn’t good for you anyway. You’ll be happier. Trust me. You’ll find someone.” You know the correct answer, but your friend can’t see it, because they’re in the moment of suffering and pain. They’re still wishing reality was different. The problem isn’t reality. The problem is their desire is colliding with reality and preventing them from seeing the truth, no matter how much you say it.
- “Tension is who you think you should be. Relaxation is who you are.” —Buddhist saying
- Almost all biases are time-saving heuristics. For important decisions, discard memory and identity, and focus on the problem.
- A lousy way to do memory prediction is “X happened in the past, therefore X will happen in the future.” It’s too based on specific circumstances. What you want is principles. You want mental models.
- If you cannot decide, the answer is no.
- “If you want it done, then go. And if not, then send.”  
- The best mental models:
    - Evolution: I think a lot of modern society can be explained through evolution.
    - Inversion: I don’t believe I have the ability to say what is going to work. Rather, I try to eliminate what’s not going to work.
    - Complexity Theory: I believe we are fundamentally ignorant and very, very bad at predicting the future.
    - Economics Microeconomics and game theory are fundamental.
    - Principal-Agent Problem:  To me, the principal-agent problem is the single most fundamental problem in microeconomics.
    - Compound interest: most of you should know it in the finance context. If you don’t, crack open a microeconomics textbook. It’s worth reading a microeconomics textbook from start to finish.
    - Basic Math: I think basic mathematics is really underrated. If you’re going to make money, if you’re going to invest money, your basic math should be really good. You don’t need to learn geometry, trigonometry, calculus, or any of the complicated stuff if you’re just going into business. But you want arithmetic, probability, and statistics. Those are extremely important.
    - Black Swans: There’s a new branch of probability statistics, which is really around tail events.
    - Calculus: Calculus is useful to know, to understand the rates of change and how nature works. But it’s more important to understand the principles of calculus—where you’re measuring the change in small discrete or small continuous events.
    - Falsifiability: Least understood, but the most important principle for anyone claiming “science” on their side—falsifiability. If it doesn’t make falsifiable predictions, it’s not science. For you to believe something is true, it should have predictive power, and it must be falsifiable.
    - Run Uphill Simple heuristic: If you’re evenly split on a difficult decision, take the path more painful in the short term.
- Most of the gains in life come from suffering in the short term so you can get paid in the long term.
- Reading science, math, and philosophy one hour per day will likely put you at the upper echelon of human success within seven years.
- Read what you love until you love to read.
- If they wrote it to make money, don’t read it.
- Maybe happiness is not something you inherit or even choose, but a highly personal skill that can be learned, like fitness or nutrition.
- I believe happiness is really a default state. Happiness is there when you remove the sense of something missing in your life.
- Happiness is the state when nothing is missing.
- We think of ourselves as fixed and the world as malleable, but it’s really we who are malleable and the world is largely fixed.
- We accept the voice in our head as the source of all truth. But all of it is malleable, and every day is new. Memory and identity are burdens from the past preventing us from living freely in the present.
- “Enlightenment is the space between your thoughts.” It means enlightenment isn’t something you achieve after thirty years sitting on a mountaintop. It’s something you can achieve moment to moment, and you can be enlightened to a certain percent every single day.
- A happy person isn’t someone who’s happy all the time. It’s someone who effortlessly interprets events in such a way that they don’t lose their innate peace.
- Looking outside yourself for anything is the fundamental delusion. Not to say you shouldn’t do things on the outside. You absolutely should. You’re a living creature. There are things you do. You locally reverse entropy. That’s why you’re here.
- Confucius says you have two lives, and the second one begins when you realize you only have one.
- “All of man’s troubles arise because he cannot sit in a room quietly by himself.” If you could just sit for thirty minutes and be happy, you are successful. That is a very powerful place to be, but very few of us get there.
- To me, the real winners are the ones who step out of the game entirely, who don’t even play the game, who rise above it. Those are the people who have such internal mental and self-control and self-awareness, they need nothing from anybody else.
- You can get almost anything you want out of life, as long as it’s one thing and you want it far more than anything else.
- Peace is happiness at rest, and happiness is peace in motion.
- We are such social creatures, we’re externally programmed and driven. We don’t know how to play and win these single-player games anymore. We compete purely in multiplayer games.
- The reality is life is a single-player game. You’re born alone. You’re going to die alone. All of your interpretations are alone. All your memories are alone. You’re gone in three generations, and nobody cares. Before you showed up, nobody cared. It’s all single player.
- Perhaps one reason why yoga and meditation are hard to sustain is they have no extrinsic value. Purely single-player games.
- What type of skill is happiness? It’s all trial and error. You just see what works. You can try sitting meditation. Did that work for you? Was it Tantra meditation or was it Vipassana meditation? Was it a ten-day retreat or was twenty minutes enough? Okay. None of those worked. But what if I tried yoga? What if I kite-surfed? What if I go car racing? What about cooking? Does that make me Zen? You literally have to try all of these things until you find something that works for you.
- Tell your friends you’re a happy person. Then, you’ll be forced to conform to it. You’ll have a consistency bias. You have to live up to it. Your friends will expect you to be a happy person.
- You always have three options: you can change it, you can accept it, or you can leave it. What is not a good option is to sit around wishing you would change it but not changing it, wishing you could leave it but not leaving it and not accepting it. That struggle or aversion is responsible for most of our misery. The phrase I probably use the most to myself in my head is just one word: “accept.”
- The combinatorics of human DNA and experience are staggering. You will never meet any two humans who are substitutable for each other.
- Your goal in life is to find the people, business, project, or art that needs you the most. There is something out there just for you. What you don’t want to do is build checklists and decision frameworks built on what other people are doing. You’re never going to be them. You’ll never be good at being somebody else.
- World’s simplest diet: The more processed the food, the less one should consume.
- The best workout for you is one you’re excited enough to do every day.
- An emotion is our evolved biology predicting the future impact of a current event. In modern settings, it’s usually exaggerated or wrong.
- Your breath is one of the few places where your autonomic nervous system meets your voluntary nervous system. It’s involuntary, but you can also control it.
- Meditation is intermittent fasting for the mind. Too much sugar leads to a heavy body, and too many distractions lead to a heavy mind.
- Life-hack: When in bed, meditate. Either you will have a deep meditation or fall asleep. Victory either way.
- If you can get a free hour of bliss every morning just by sitting and closing your eyes, that is worth its weight in gold. It will change your life.
- Insight meditation lets you run your brain in debug mode until you realize you’re just a subroutine in a larger program.
- Modern humans, we don’t live enough in our bodies. We don’t live enough in our awareness. We live too much in this internal monologue in our heads. All of which is just programmed into you by society and by the environment when you were younger.
- When you say, “I’m going to do this,” and “I’m going to be that,” you’re really putting it off. You’re giving yourself an out. At least if you’re self-aware, you can think, “‘I say I want to do this, but I don’t really because if I really wanted to do it, I would just do it.”
- Everyone’s motivated at something. It just depends on the thing. Even the people that we say are unmotivated are suddenly really motivated when they’re playing video games. I think motivation is relative, so you just have to find the thing you’re into.
- Grind and sweat, toil and bleed, face the abyss. It’s all part of becoming an overnight success.
- You should know statistics and probability forwards and backwards and inside out.
- Nature speaks in mathematics. Mathematics is us reverse engineering the language of nature, and we have only scratched the surface. The good news is you don’t have to know a lot of math. You just have to know basic statistics, arithmetic, etc. You should know statistics and probability forwards and backwards and inside out.
- The hardest thing is not doing what you want—it’s knowing what you want.
- Honesty is a core, core, core value. By honesty, I mean I want to be able to just be me. I never want to be in an environment or around people where I have to watch what I say. If I disconnect what I’m thinking from what I’m saying, it creates multiple threads in my mind. I’m no longer in the moment—now I have to be future-planning or past-regretting every time I talk to somebody. Anyone around whom I can’t be fully honest, I don’t want to be around.
- Try everything, test it for yourself, be skeptical, keep what’s useful, and discard what’s not.
- Read enough, and you become a connoisseur. Then you naturally gravitate more toward theory, concepts, nonfiction.
- I once asked a monk how he found peace. “I say ‘yes,’” he’d said. “To all that happens, I say ‘yes.’”
- I always spent money on books. I never viewed that as an expense. That’s an investment to me.
- If you eat, invest, and think according to what the “news” advocates, you’ll end up nutritionally, financially, and morally bankrupt.
- Health, love, and your mission, in that order. Nothing else matters.
