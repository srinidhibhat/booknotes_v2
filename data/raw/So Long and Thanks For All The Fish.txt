So Long and Thanks For All The Fish
by Douglas Adams

- He had read somewhere that the Eskimos had over two hundred different words for snow, without which their conversation would probably have got very monotonous.
- The wind flicked about a little, like the tail of a horse that's trying to decide what sort of mood it's in tonight, and a bell somewhere chimed midnight. 
- He could sense, too, the thrill of being a tree, which was something he hadn't expected. He knew that it felt good to curl your toes in the earth, but he'd never realized it could feel quite as good as that. 
- Summary: Earth is alive again (don't know how). Arthur and Fenchurch fall in love. They meet Ford Prefect (who came in a ship form other galaxy). Arthur and Fenchurch along with Ford board the ship and leave earth. They go to some place, find Marvin in a bad condition and they all together read "God's Final Message To His Creation" which is "We apologise for the inconvenience". And then Marvin dies.
