SIDDHARTHA
by Hermann Hesse, Digital Fire
- Experience is the aggregate of conscious events experienced by a human in life – it connotes participation, learning and knowledge. Understanding is comprehension and internalization.
- One goal loomed before Siddhartha, and only one: to become empty, to be empty of thirst, of wishing, of dreams—empty of all joy and pain.
- It has required a great deal of time, and even now I have not come to the end of the journey of learning this fact, O Govinda: that man can learn nothing! The thing that we call ‘learning’ is, in truth, nonexistent! It is inherent, oh my friend, in a knowledge that is everywhere, that is Atman; it is in me and in you and in every essence. I am starting to believe that this knowledge has no more aggressive enemy than learning and the desire for knowledge.”
- “The Buddha has robbed me,” thought Siddhartha, “he has robbed me, and he has given as a gift much more to me. He has robbed me of my friend, the one who had believed in me and now believes in him, who had been my shadow and is now Gotama’s shadow. But he has given me Siddhartha, myself.”
- It was lovely and beautiful to walk through the world like this, childlike and fully awake, open to what is near and without mistrust.
- Everyone can perform magic; everyone can reach his goals, if he is able to think, to wait, and to fast.”
- Most people, Kamala, are like a falling leaf that is blown and is turning around through the air, wavering and tumbling to the ground. But others, a few, are like stars: they go on a fixed course, no wind reaches them, and in themselves they have their law and their direction.
- “Things are going in a downward spiral for you!” he said to himself, and laughed about it. As he was saying this, he happened to glance at the river, and he saw that the river was also going downwards, always moving downhill while singing and being happy through it all.
- Oh how good it is to have fled and to have become free! How clean and beautiful is the air here; how good it is to breathe it!
- “It’s good,” he thought, “to taste for one’s self all that which one needs to know. The lust for the world and wealth were not among the best things in life; I already learned this as a child. I have known it for a long time, but have only experienced this now. And now I know this, not just in my mind, but in my eyes, my heart, and my stomach. Bravo for me because I know this!”
- But out of all the secrets of the river, he saw only one today, and it touched his soul. He saw that this water ran and ran incessantly, and nevertheless was always there at all times, the same and yet new every moment!
- Have transported many people—thousands—and for all these, my river has been nothing more than an obstacle in their travels. They travel seeking money and business, and for weddings and pilgrimages, and the river obstructs their path, and it is the job of the ferryman to get them quickly across this obstacle. But for a few among the thousands—four or five—the river has stopped becoming an obstacle. They have heard its voice and listened to it, and the river has become as sacred to them as it is to me.
- Nothing was and nothing will be: everything is, and everything is present and has existence.”
- Ah, were not all sufferings then time, and were not all self-torments and personal fears time? Weren’t all the difficult and hostile things in the world gone and overcome as soon as one had overcome time, and as soon as time could be thrust out of the mind?
- Knowledge can be transferred, but not wisdom. It can be found and lived, and it is possible to be carried by it.
- The world, my friend Govinda, is not imperfect or on a slow path towards perfection; no, it is perfect every moment.
- I had to learn how to leave the world as it is, to love it, and to enjoy being a part of it.
