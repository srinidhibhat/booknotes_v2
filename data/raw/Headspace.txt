The Headspace Guide to Meditation and Mindfulness 
by Andy Puddicombe
====================================================
- It’s hard to deal with grief at any age. We’re not trained for it, there’s no formula for it, and most of us get by as best we can.
- Often in life we get so caught up in the analysis, the dissection of every possible outcome, that we miss an opportunity altogether. Of course, some things require careful consideration, but the more we live mindfully, in the moment, the more we start to get a sense of what feels right. Whether you think of it as a gut feeling, intuition, being guided, or just knowing for yourself that it’s the right thing to do, this can be an incredibly liberating discovery.
- It’s usually when we’re caught up in all the little things that we start to make mistakes.
- Mindfulness means to be present. It means being “in the moment,” experiencing life directly as it unfolds, rather than being distracted, caught up and lost in thought. It’s not a contrived or temporary state of mind that you need to somehow create and maintain. On the contrary, it’s a way of stepping back and resting the mind in its natural state, free from the usual chaos.
- Meditation is simply a technique to provide you with the optimum conditions for practicing the skill of mindfulness.
- If mindfulness is the ability to be present, to rest in the moment whatever you’re doing, and meditation is the best way of learning that skill, then “headspace” could be considered the outcome.
- What is headspace? If mindfulness is the ability to be present, to rest in the moment whatever you’re doing, and meditation is the best way of learning that skill, then “headspace” could be considered the outcome.
- Headspace is not a quality of mind dependent on surface emotions; this means it can be experienced just as clearly in periods of sadness or anger as it can in times of excitement and laughter. Essentially it’s “being okay” with whatever thoughts you’re experiencing or emotions you’re feeling.
- Sometimes there’ll be external situations that require change, that might even demand change, and you’ll need to handle these situations skillfully, with mindfulness. But when it comes to the way you think and feel about those situations, the starting point is to acknowledge that it’s the mind itself that defines your experience. This is why training the mind is so important.

This is why training the mind is so important. By changing the way in which you see the world, you effectively change the world around you.
- We’re so busy doing stuff the whole time that we no longer have any reference point for what it means to be still, simply resting the mind.
- The first thing to get straight is that meditation does not make you think! All it does is shine a big bright light on your mind so that you can see it more clearly. This bright light is awareness. You may not like what you see when you switch the light on, but it’s a clear and accurate reflection of how your mind behaves on a daily basis.
- Don’t make the mistake of thinking that all thoughts are bad. They’re not—we just need to know how to relate to them. What you need to ask yourself,” he continued, “is how much of your thinking is helpful, productive, and how much is unhelpful or unproductive. Only you know the answer to that.
- Meditation, within a mindful context, was not about stopping thoughts and controlling the mind. It was a process of giving up control, of stepping back, learning how to focus the attention in a passive way, while simply resting the mind in its own natural awareness
- “Imagine a clear blue sky,” he began. “Feels nice, yes? It’s very hard to feel down when the sky’s blue like that. Now, imagine that your mind is like this blue sky. I’m not talking about all the thoughts, confusion and craziness,” he said chuckling. “I’m talking about the underlying essence of mind, the natural state. It doesn’t matter whether this is your experience right now,” he said, “simply imagine for a moment that this is how things are. In fact, think back to the last time you felt very happy and relaxed and it’s probably not so very difficult to imagine. Okay,” he said, “now imagine a very cloudy day, no blue sky at all, just big, dark, heavy clouds.” He said each word very slowly, as if to emphasize the point. “How does that make you feel?” he asked, still smiling, “not so good, right? Now, imagine those clouds are the thoughts in your mind, how sometimes they’re fluffy and white and appear quite friendly, whereas at other times they appear dark and heavy. The color of the clouds simply reflects your feeling or mood at the time. In order to get to this monastery you must have flown in a plane?” he asked, knowing full well what the answer would be. I agreed. “Was it cloudy when you left?” he asked. “It’s always cloudy in England,” I replied, smiling. “Well then,” he said, “you’ll know that if you get in a plane and fly up through the clouds, there’s nothing but blue sky on the other side. Even when it appears as though there’s nothing but big, dark, heavy clouds, there’s always blue sky there.” There was no denying it, I’d flown a lot over the years and he was right. “So,” he said, shrugging his shoulders, “the sky is always blue.”
- Imagine what it would be like to have a place within your own mind which is always calm, always still and always clear; a place that you can always return to, a sense of being at ease or at peace with whatever is happening in your life.
- “Happiness is just happiness,” he went on, “no big deal. It comes and it goes. Sadness is just sadness, no big deal. It comes and it goes. If you can give up your desire to always experience pleasant things, at the same time as giving up your fear of experiencing unpleasant things, then you’ll have a quiet mind.”
- When it comes to emotions it’s the case that whatever goes down, must come up. Emotion itself is often not the problem. It’s the way we react to it that causes the problem. The filter of emotion creates the illusion of how our world looks at any one time. Headspace does not mean being free from emotions, but rather existing in a place where you are at ease with whatever emotion is present.
- For example, you may well think, much like myself at the time, that if you’ve seen one breath then you’ve seen them all. And if this is your attitude to following the breath, then you’ll undoubtedly lose interest very quickly. But if you take the time to look a little more closely, you’ll notice that each and every breath is actually quite unique. The same can be said of the thoughts that pass through the mind.
- Each new thought, like a pebble being thrown into the water, creates ripples on the surface. We’ve got so used to throwing these pebbles, so used to the disturbance on the surface of the water, that we’ve forgotten what still water looks like. We know it’s not quite right as it is, but it’s as if the more we meddle with the mind trying to sort it out, the more ripples we create.
- If you’re distracted, then it’s not meditation. Only if you’re undistracted is it meditation. There’s no such thing as good and bad meditation, there is only distracted or undistracted, aware or unaware.
- Being aware that you haven’t got a clue is still being aware.
- It’s best to think of insight as drips of water filling a bucket, rather than any great thunderbolt that might transform your life instantaneously.
- We’re often so distracted by our own thoughts that we don’t even really hear what the other person is saying.
- It doesn’t matter whether we live a very physical life or a sedentary life, there is just as much time to be aware cycling down the road as there is sitting in a chair at home. And nor does it matter what type of job we have. We all follow the same twenty-four-hour clock, so we all have the same amount of time to train in awareness. Whether we’re aware of the physical senses, our emotions, our thoughts, or the content of those thoughts, it’s all awareness and there is always time to be aware.
- Rather than thinking of just being mindful during your ten minutes of meditation each morning (and then trying to make it through the next twenty-three hours and fifty minutes of your day until you meditate again) maybe start to think of mindfulness in terms of something you can apply throughout your day. Remember, all it means is to give your full attention to whatever you’re doing, whenever you’re doing it. The implication of this is that it’s simply no longer possible to think about where you’d rather be, what you’d rather be doing, or wishing that things were different from the way they are (all the types of thinking that usually leave you feeling stressed out), because you’ll be present with whatever you’re doing instead.
- How many of us live our lives in this way? Swept away by memories of the past and plans for the future. So preoccupied with thinking that we’re completely unaware of what’s actually taking place right now, oblivious to life unfolding around us. The present moment just feels so ordinary that we take it for granted, and yet that’s what makes it so extraordinary — the fact that we so rarely experience the present moment exactly as it is. And quite unlike anything else in life, you don’t need to go anywhere to get it, or do anything to create it. It’s right here, no matter what you’re doing. It’s in the eating of a sandwich, the drinking of a cup of tea, the washing of the dishes … ordinary, everyday activities. This is what it means to be mindful, to be present, to be aware.
- Whatever it is that causes the mind to wander off, it’s a movement away from the present moment, away from the direct experience of life. It can sometimes feel as though we’re so busy remembering, planning and analyzing life, that we forget to experience life—as it actually is, rather than how we think it should be.
- The body and mind are not separate. When we have presence of mind we have presence of body, when we possess mental focus we possess physical focus, and when we have an ease of mind we have an ease of body
- We’re so used to doing something that we find the idea of doing nothing somewhat alien or boring at first. You don’t need to think of meditation as “working on yourself,” it’s simply ten minutes out of your day to allow the body and mind to unwind, while becoming more familiar with the idea of being present, of being aware.
