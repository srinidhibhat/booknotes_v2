For One More Day
by Mitch Albom

- The thing when your parents are no more, you feel like instead of going into every fight with backup, you are going into every fight alone. 
- What is it about childhood that never lets you go, even when you're so wrecked it's hard to believe you were ever a child?
- Mom - It's just a sound really, a hum interrupted by open lips. But there are a zillion words on this planet, and not one of them comes out of your mouth the way that does. 
- "So, now you know how badly someone wanted you, Charley. Children forget that sometimes. They think of themselves as a burden instead of a wish granted."
- Going back to something is harder than you think. 
- I met a man once who did a lot of mountain climbing. I asked him which was harder, ascending or descending? He said without a doubt descending, because ascending you were so focused on reaching the top, you avoided mistakes. 
- I hope you never hear those words - Your Mom, she Died. They are different that other words. They are too big to fit in your ears. They belong to some strange, heavy, powerful languages that pounds away at the side of your head, a wrecking ball coming at you again and again, until finally, the words crack a hole large enough to fit inside your brain. And in so doing, they split you apart. 
- When you look at your Mother, you are looking at the purest love you will ever know. 
- My Mother, somewhere between this world and the next, gave me one more day I'd wanted so badly. 
- I believe my Mother saved my life. I also believe that parents, will hold you up safely, above their swirling waters, and sometimes that means you will never know what they endured, and you may treat them unkindly, in a way you otherwise wouldn't. But there's a story behind everything. How a picture got on a wall. How a scar got on your face. Sometimes the stories are simple, and sometimes they are hard and heartbreaking. But behind all your stories is always your mother's story, because here is where yours begins. 
-  A week before his stroke, he seemed to sense that his time was short. He told those around him, "Remember me for these days, not the old ones." 
- Because there was a ghost involved you may call this a ghost story. But what family isn't a ghost story? Sharing tales of those we've lost is how we keep from really losing them.
