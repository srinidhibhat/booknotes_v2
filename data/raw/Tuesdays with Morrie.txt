Tuesdays with Morrie
by Mitch Albom

- I'm on the last great journey here - and people want me to tell them what to pack.
- The culture we have does not make people feel good about themselves. And you have to be strong enough to say if the culture doesn't work, don't buy it.
- Maybe death is the great equalizer, the one big thing that can finally make strangers shed a tear for one another.
- Everybody knows they're going to die, but nobody believes it. If we did, we would do things differently.
- He nodded toward the window with the sunshine streaming in. "You see that? You can go out there, out side, anytime. You can run up and down the block and go crazy. I can't do that. I can't go out. I can't run. I can't be out there without fear of getting sick. But you know what? I appreciate that window more than you do."
Appreciate it?
"Yes. I look out that window every day. I notice the change in the trees, how strong the wind is blowing. It's as if I can see time actually passing through that window pane. Because I know my time is almost done, I am drawn to nature like I'm seeing it for the first time."
- "And this is where detachment comes in. If I die in the middle of a coughing spell like I just had, I need to be able to detach from the horror, I need to say, 'This is my
moment.' I don't want to leave the world in a state of fright. I want to know what's happening, accept it, get to a peaceful place, and let go."
- Aging is not just decay, you know. It's growth. It's more than the negative that you're going to die, it's also the positive that you understand you're going to die, and that you live a better life because of it.
- Don't let go too soon, but don't hang on too long.
- As long as we can love each other, and remember the feeling of love we had, we can die without ever really going away. All the love you created is still there. All the memories are still there. You live on-in the hearts of everyone you have touched and nurtured while here. Death ends a life, not a relationship.
- I look back sometimes at the person I was before I rediscovered my old professor. I want to talk to that person. I want to tell him what to look out for, what mistakes to avoid. I want to tell him to be more open, to ignore the lure of advertised values, to pay attention when your loved ones are speaking, as if it were the last time you might hear them.
- Have you ever really had a teacher? One who saw you as a raw but precious thing, a jewel that, with wisdom, could be polished to a proud shine? If you are lucky enough to find your way to such teachers, you will always find your way back. Sometimes it is only in your head. Sometimes it is right alongside their beds.
