The 4-Hour Workweek
by Tim Ferriss

- People don't want to be millionaires - they want to experience what they believe only millions can buy. 
- An expert is a person who has made all the mistakes that can be made in a very narrow field - Niels Bohr.
- Different is better when it is more effective or more fun. Walking down the streets on hands, wearing an underwear outside you pants may make you different but is not comfortable. 
- Retirement must be worst-case-scenario insurance. Do not make happy retirement as a goal. You'll dislike the process for reaching there. It means you're disliking your current life. Plan mini-retirements (like vacation for 1 week after 2 months work).
- The timing is never right. You'll say "Some day I'll do this." That "some day" will never arrive. Just do it and correct course along the way.
- Ask for forgiveness, not permission. Trying and saying sorry later (if you screw up) is better than not trying it at all.
- Emphasize strengths, don't fix weaknesses. Focus on better use of your best weapons instead of constant repair. 
- There are 2 types of stress:
    1. Distress: bad for health, destructive criticism - avoid.
    2. Eustress: healthful and stimulus for growth, constructive criticism - embrace.
- Many a false step was made by standing still.
- Aim big - very big. Dream about unrealistic goals. There is less competition for bigger goals. 
- Opposite of love is indifference (not hate). Opposite of happiness is boredom (not sadness). So instead of "What do I want?" Or "What are my goals?", ask "What would excite me?".
- Let's say you work 10 hours a week and produce twice the results of people working 40 hours. Bit it doesn't mean if you work for 40 hours a week you can produce 8 times the results! - It doesn't work that way.
- Doing more is not productive. Being busy is laziness. Being selective - doing less - is the path of the productive. Focus on the important few and ignore the rest. 
- Two synergistic approaches for productivity: 
    1. Limit tasks to the important to shorten work time (80/20 rule - Pareto principle).
    2. Shorten work time to limit tasks to the important (Parkinson's law).
- Limit other's access to your time. Don't let people who you do not value or who doesn't matter to you eat up your time. Tell them you've got 5 minutes and finish it in a hurry. Cut off email time and phone time. Check those only once or twice in a week. It will save lot of time.
- Outsource your job. If someone else can do your job in less time (or even time consuming jobs), if they charge you anything less than your hourly income, just outsource it. It saves you time to think and do bigger things (Brickwork is a good Bengaluru based outsourcing company). 
- Get an assistant - even if you don't need one. Develop the comfort of commanding and not being commanded. 
- Do not tun the business - own the business and spend no time on them. Do you think Microsoft manufactures Xbox 360 or that Kodak designs and distributes their digital cameras? Flextronics, a Singapore based engineering and manufacturing firm with $15.3 Billion in annual revenue does both. 
- Creating the demand is difficult. Filling the demand is easy. It is more profitable to be a big fish in a small pond than a small undefined fish in a big pond. Make a product in a market where there is less competition. 
- Minimize the options for your customer and provide best service in them. Less options - Less decisions to make. 
- It isn't enough to think outside the box. Thinking is passive. Get used to acting outside the box. Ex: Relax in public. Lie down on the road (or whatever) for 10 seconds. Then get up and walk away. 
- Make mistakes of ambition and not mistakes of sloth. Develop the strength to do bold things, not the strength to suffer.
- After getting freed from a previous job and trying for a new job, if the interviewer asks "Why you left you previous job?," the answer is: "I had a once-in-a-lifetime chance to do [exotic and envy-producing experience] and couldn't turn it down. I figured that, with [20 - 40] years of work to go, what's the rush?"
- Travel more. Take mini-retirements (15-30 days). Plan thoroughly. Take less things with you. If you calculate correctly, traveling expenses and living somewhere for a month can cost you less than your normal expenses of a month.
- Man is so made that he can only find relaxation from one kind of labor by taking up another.
- Subtracting the bad does not create the good. It just leaves a vacuum. 
- **Adults are always asking kids what they want to be when they grow up because they are looking for ideas.** 

**Slow Dance - A Poem by David L. Weatherford**

<em>Have you ever watched kids on a merry-go-round,  
or listened to rain slapping the ground?  

Ever followed a butterfly’s erratic flight,  
or gazed at the sun fading into the night?  

You better slow down, don’t dance so fast,  
time is short, the music won’t last.  

Do you run through each day on the fly,  
when you ask “How are you?”, do you hear the reply?  

When the day is done, do you lie in your bed,  
with the next hundred chores running through your head?  

You better slow down, don’t dance so fast,  
time is short, the music won’t last.  

Ever told your child, we’ll do it tomorrow,  
and in your haste, not see his sorrow?  

Ever lost touch, let a friendship die,  
’cause you never had time to call and say hi?  

You better slow down, don’t dance so fast,  
time is short, the music won’t last.  

When you run so fast to get somewhere,  
you miss half the fun of getting there.  

When you worry and hurry through your day,  
it’s like an unopened gift thrown away.  

Life isn’t a race, so take it slower,  
hear the music before your song is over.</em>
