ATOMIC HABITS
by James Clear
- We all deal with setbacks but in the long run, the quality of our lives often depends on the quality of our habits.
- You get what you repeat.
- Habits often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance.
- Change can take years—before it happens all at once.
- FORGET ABOUT GOALS, FOCUS ON SYSTEMS INSTEAD
- Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. Getting 1 percent better every day counts for a lot in the long-run. 
- Habits are a double-edged sword. They can work for you or against you, which is why understanding the details is essential. 
- Small changes often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold. The most powerful outcomes of any compounding process are delayed. You need to be patient. 
- An atomic habit is a little habit that is part of a larger system. Just as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results. 
- If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead. 
- You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.
- Many people begin the process of changing their habits by focusing on what they want to achieve. This leads us to outcome-based habits. The alternative is to build identity-based habits. With this approach, we start by focusing on who we wish to become.
- The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. It’s one thing to say I’m the type of person who wants this. It’s something very different to say I’m the type of person who is this.
- The goal is not to learn an instrument, the goal is to become a musician.
- Your identity is literally your “repeated beingness.”
- Decide the type of person you want to be. Prove it to yourself with small wins.
- There are three levels of change: outcome change, process change, and identity change.
- The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become.
- Your identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.
- Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity. 
- The real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better results (although they can do that), but because they can change your beliefs about yourself.
- A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic.
- The ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems of life with as little energy and effort as possible. 
- Any habit can be broken down into a feedback loop that involves four steps: cue, craving, response, and reward. 
- The Four Laws of Behavior Change are a simple set of rules we can use to build better habits. They are (1) make it obvious, (2) make it attractive, (3) make it easy, and (4) make it satisfying.
- The human brain is a prediction machine.
- Carl Jung said, “Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.”
- With enough practice, your brain will pick up on the cues that predict certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it. 
- Once our habits become automatic, we stop paying attention to what we are doing. 
- The process of behavior change always starts with awareness. You need to be aware of your habits before you can change them. 
- Pointing-and-Calling raises your level of awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level by verbalizing your actions. 
- The Habits Scorecard is a simple exercise you can use to become more aware of your behavior.
- One of the best ways to build a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top. This is called habit stacking.
- The two most common cues are time and location. 
- Creating an implementation intention is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a specific time and location. 
- The implementation intention formula is: I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]. 
- Habit stacking is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a current habit. 
- The habit stacking formula is: After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].
- If you want to make a habit a big part of your life, make the cue a big part of your environment.
- Small changes in context can lead to large changes in behavior over time. 
- Every habit is initiated by a cue. We are more likely to notice cues that stand out. 
- Make the cues of good habits obvious in your environment. 
- Gradually, your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behavior. The context becomes the cue. 
- It is easier to build new habits in a new environment because you are not fighting against old cues.
- So, yes, perseverance, grit, and willpower are essential to success, but the way to improve these qualities is not by wishing you were a more disciplined person, but by creating a more disciplined environment.
- Once a habit is formed, it is unlikely to be forgotten. 
- People with high self-control tend to spend less time in tempting situations. It’s easier to avoid temptation than resist it. 
- One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it. 
- Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one.
- We have the brains of our ancestors but temptations they never had to face.
- The more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-forming. 
- Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. When dopamine rises, so does our motivation to act. 
- It is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulfillment of it—that gets us to take action. The greater the anticipation, the greater the dopamine spike. 
- Temptation bundling is one way to make your habits more attractive. The strategy is to pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do.
- The culture we live in determines which behaviors are attractive to us. 
- We tend to adopt habits that are praised and approved of by our culture because we have a strong desire to fit in and belong to the tribe. 
- We tend to imitate the habits of three social groups: the close (family and friends), the many (the tribe), and the powerful (those with status and prestige). 
- One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal behavior and (2) you already have something in common with the group. 
- The normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desired behavior of the individual. Most days, we’d rather be wrong with the crowd than be right by ourselves. 
- If a behavior can get us approval, respect, and praise, we find it attractive.
- Every behavior has a surface level craving and a deeper underlying motive. 
- Your habits are modern-day solutions to ancient desires. 
- The cause of your habits is actually the prediction that precedes them. The prediction leads to a feeling. 
- Highlight the benefits of avoiding a bad habit to make it seem unattractive. 
- Habits are attractive when we associate them with positive feelings and unattractive when we associate them with negative feelings. Create a motivation ritual by doing something you enjoy immediately before a difficult habit.
- When preparation becomes a form of procrastination, you need to change something. You don’t want to merely be planning. You want to be practicing.
- The most effective form of learning is practice, not planning. 
- Focus on taking action, not being in motion. 
- Habit formation is the process by which a behavior becomes progressively more automatic through repetition. 
- The amount of time you have been performing a habit is not as important as the number of times you have performed it.
- Human behavior follows the Law of Least Effort. We will naturally gravitate toward the option that requires the least amount of work. 
- Create an environment where doing the right thing is as easy as possible. 
- Reduce the friction associated with good behaviors. When friction is low, habits are easy. 
- Increase the friction associated with bad behaviors. When friction is high, habits are difficult. 
- Prime your environment to make future actions easier.
- The difference between a good day and a bad day is often a few productive and healthy choices made at decisive moments. Each one is like a fork in the road, and these choices stack up throughout the day and can ultimately lead to very different outcomes.
- You have to standardize before you can optimize.
- Habits can be completed in a few seconds but continue to impact your behavior for minutes or hours afterward. 
- Many habits occur at decisive moments—choices that are like a fork in the road—and either send you in the direction of a productive day or an unproductive one. 
- The Two-Minute Rule states, “When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.” 
- The more you ritualize the beginning of a process, the more likely it becomes that you can slip into the state of deep focus that is required to do great things. 
- Standardize before you optimize. You can’t improve a habit that doesn’t exist.
- During the year I was writing this book, I experimented with a new time management strategy. Every Monday, my assistant would reset the passwords on all my social media accounts, which logged me out on each device. All week I worked without distraction. On Friday, she would send me the new passwords. I had the entire weekend to enjoy what social media had to offer until Monday morning when she would do it again. (If you don’t have an assistant, team up with a friend or family member and reset each other’s passwords each week.)
- A commitment device is a choice you make in the present that locks in better behavior in the future. 
- The ultimate way to lock in future behavior is to automate your habits. 
- Onetime choices—like buying a better mattress or enrolling in an automatic savings plan—are single actions that automate your future habits and deliver increasing returns over time. 
- Using technology to automate your habits is the most reliable and effective way to guarantee the right behavior.
- It almost always happens that when the immediate consequence is favorable, the later consequences are disastrous, and vice versa
- We are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is satisfying. 
- The human brain evolved to prioritize immediate rewards over delayed rewards. 
- The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided. 
- To get a habit to stick you need to feel immediately successful—even if it’s in a small way. 
- The first three laws of behavior change—make it obvious, make it attractive, and make it easy—increase the odds that a behavior will be performed this time. The fourth law of behavior change—make it satisfying—increases the odds that a behavior will be repeated next time.
- If you start with $100, then a 50 percent gain will take you to $150. But you only need a 33 percent loss to take you back to $100. In other words, avoiding a 33 percent loss is just as valuable as achieving a 50 percent gain. As Charlie Munger says, “The first rule of compounding: Never interrupt it unnecessarily.”
- When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.
- One of the most satisfying feelings is the feeling of making progress. 
- A habit tracker is a simple way to measure whether you did a habit—like marking an X on a calendar. 
- Habit trackers and other visual forms of measurement can make your habits satisfying by providing clear evidence of your progress. 
- Don’t break the chain. Try to keep your habit streak alive. 
- Never miss twice. If you miss one day, try to get back on track as quickly as possible. 
- Just because you can measure something doesn’t mean it’s the most important thing.
- We are less likely to repeat a bad habit if it is painful or unsatisfying. 
- An accountability partner can create an immediate cost to inaction. We care deeply about what others think of us, and we do not want others to have a lesser opinion of us. 
- A habit contract can be used to add a social cost to any behavior. It makes the costs of violating your promises public and painful. 
- Knowing that someone else is watching you can be a powerful motivator.
- HOW TO CREATE A GOOD HABIT The 1st Law Make It Obvious 1.1 Fill out the Habits Scorecard. Write down your current habits to become aware of them. 1.2 Use implementation intentions: “I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].” 1.3 Use habit stacking: “After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].” 1.4 Design your environment. Make the cues of good habits obvious and visible. The 2nd Law Make It Attractive 2.1 Use temptation bundling. Pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do. 2.2 Join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior. 2.3 Create a motivation ritual. Do something you enjoy immediately before a difficult habit. The 3rd Law Make It Easy 3.1 Reduce friction. Decrease the number of steps between you and your good habits. 3.2 Prime the environment. Prepare your environment to make future actions easier. 3.3 Master the decisive moment. Optimize the small choices that deliver outsized impact. 3.4 Use the Two-Minute Rule. Downscale your habits until they can be done in two minutes or less. 3.5 Automate your habits. Invest in technology and onetime purchases that lock in future behavior. The 4th Law Make It Satisfying 4.1 Use reinforcement. Give yourself an immediate reward when you complete your habit. 4.2 Make “doing nothing” enjoyable. When avoiding a bad habit, design a way to see the benefits. 4.3 Use a habit tracker. Keep track of your habit streak and “don’t break the chain.” 4.4 Never miss twice. When you forget to do a habit, make sure you get back on track immediately.
- Genes do not determine your destiny. They determine your areas of opportunity.
- As you explore different options, there are a series of questions you can ask yourself to continually narrow in on the habits and areas that will be most satisfying to you: What feels like fun to me, but work to others? The mark of whether you are made for a task is not whether you love it but whether you can handle the pain of the task easier than most people. When are you enjoying yourself while other people are complaining? The work that hurts you less than it hurts others is the work you were made to do. What makes me lose track of time? Flow is the mental state you enter when you are so focused on the task at hand that the rest of the world fades away.19 This blend of happiness and peak performance is what athletes and performers experience when they are “in the zone.” It is nearly impossible to experience a flow state and not find the task satisfying at least to some degree. Where do I get greater returns than the average person? We are continually comparing ourselves to those around us, and a behavior is more likely to be satisfying when the comparison is in our favor. When I started writing at jamesclear.com, my email list grew very quickly. I wasn’t quite sure what I was doing well, but I knew that results seemed to be coming faster for me than for some of my colleagues, which motivated me to keep writing. What comes naturally to me? For just a moment, ignore what you have been taught. Ignore what society has told you. Ignore what others expect of you. Look inside yourself and ask, “What feels natural to me? When have I felt alive? When have I felt like the real me?” No internal judgments or people-pleasing. No second-guessing or self-criticism. Just feelings of engagement and enjoyment. Whenever you feel authentic and genuine, you are headed in the right direction.
- When you can’t win by being better, you can win by being different. By combining your skills, you reduce the level of competition, which makes it easier to stand out.
- Until you work as hard as those you admire, don’t explain away their success as luck.
- The secret to maximizing your odds of success is to choose the right field of competition. 
- Pick the right habit and progress is easy. Pick the wrong habit and life is a struggle. 
- Genes cannot be easily changed, which means they provide a powerful advantage in favorable circumstances and a serious disadvantage in unfavorable circumstances. 
- Habits are easier when they align with your natural abilities. Choose the habits that best suit you. 
- Play a game that favors your strengths. If you can’t find a game that favors you, create one. 
- Genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They clarify it. They tell us what to work hard on.
- The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. 
- The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom. 
- As habits become routine, they become less interesting and less satisfying. We get bored. 
- Anyone can work hard when they feel motivated. It’s the ability to keep going when work isn’t exciting that makes the difference. 
- Professionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the way.
- “keep your identity small.”10 The more you let a single belief define you, the less capable you are of adapting when life challenges you.
- Men are born soft and supple; dead, they are stiff and hard. Plants are born tender and pliant; dead, they are brittle and dry. Thus whoever is stiff and inflexible is a disciple of death. Whoever is soft and yielding is a disciple of life. The hard and stiff will be broken. The soft and supple will prevail. —LAO TZU
- The upside of habits is that we can do things without thinking. The downside is that we stop paying attention to little errors. 
- Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery 
- Reflection and review is a process that allows you to remain conscious of your performance over time. 
- The tighter we cling to an identity, the harder it becomes to grow beyond it.
- The secret to getting results that last is to never stop making improvements. It’s remarkable what you can build if you just don’t stop. It’s remarkable the business you can build if you don’t stop working. It’s remarkable the body you can build if you don’t stop training. It’s remarkable the knowledge you can build if you don’t stop learning. It’s remarkable the fortune you can build if you don’t stop saving. It’s remarkable the friendships you can build if you don’t stop caring. Small habits don’t add up. They compound. That’s the power of atomic habits. Tiny changes. Remarkable results.
- The brain overestimates the danger of anything that seems like an immediate threat but has almost no likelihood of actually occurring: your plane crashing during a bit of turbulence, a burglar breaking in while you’re home alone, a terrorist blowing up the bus you’re on. Meanwhile, it underestimates what appears to be a distant threat but is actually very likely: the steady accumulation of fat from eating unhealthy food, the gradual decay of your muscles from sitting at a desk, the slow creep of clutter when you fail to tidy up.
