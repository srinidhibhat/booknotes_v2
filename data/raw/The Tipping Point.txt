The Tipping Point
by Malcolm Gladwell

- Three rules of the Tipping Point:
    1. The law of the few: Tiny percentage of people do the majority of the work. 
    2. The stickiness factor: The message must make an impact. It should stick into memory. 
    3. Power of context: Human beings are lot more sensitive to their environment than they may seem.
- If a person is in need of help, the probability of he getting help if he is surrounded by a single person is a lot more than when he is surrounded by more number of people. 
- Word of mouth is - even in this age of mass communication and multi-million dollar advertising campaigns - is still the most important form of human communication.
- When - the so called *Connectors* - Lois Welberg or Roger Horchow looks out at the world or sits next to you on an airplane, they don't see the same world that the rest of us see. They see possibility and while most of us are busily choosing whom we would like to know, and rejecting the people who don't look right or who live out near the airport, or whom we haven't seen in sixty-five years, Lois and Roger like them all. 
- *Acquaintances* - who are weak ties are more important for finding new jobs, ideas or information. Because, your friends occupy the same world that you do. But acquaintances, occupy a very different world than you. They are the social power. More acquaintances you have - more powerful you are. 
- *Mavens* are data banks. They provide the message. *Connectors* are social glue; they spread it. But there is also a select group of people - Salesmen. With the skills to persuade us when we are unconvinced of what we are hearing. These are 3 types of people who are critical to the tipping point of word-of-mouth epidemics. 
- Salesman can persuade from the outside-in, an external gesture affecting an internal decision. Ex:  A debate was going on. It was recorded and played in headphones. For a part of the group, they were told to nod their heads sideways and the other part - up and down. The ones who nodded sideways disobeyed the theory while the others obeyed. Their way of nodding affected their mindset and their decision.
- Adults watch television when they are simulated and look away when they're bored. But children watch TV when they understand and look away when they're confused. 
- The Law of the Few says that there are exceptional people out there who are capable of starting epidemics. All you have to do is find them. Similarly, there is a simple way to package information that, under the right circumstances, can make it irresistible (stickiness). All you have to do is find it. 
- When it comes to interpreting other people's behavior, human beings invariably make the mistake of overestimating the importance of  fundamental character traits and underestimating the importance of the situation and context. 
- 'Character' isn't a stable, easily identifiable set of closely related traits. Character is more like a bundle of habits and tendencies and interests, loosely bound together and dependent, at certain times, on circumstance and context.
- The convictions of your heart and the actual content of your thoughts are less important in guiding your actions than the immediate context of your behavior. 
- A child is better off in a good neighborhood and a troubled family than he or she is in a troubled neighborhood and a good family. Children are powerfully shaped by their external environment. 
- 'Hush Puppies' sales tipped because the youth wanted to wear what no one was wearing.
- Rule of 150: "The figure of 150 seems to represent the maximum number of individuals with whom we can have a genuinely social relationship, the kind of relationship that goes with knowing who they are and how they relate to us." When people get larger than 150 in a group, they become strangers to one another. 
- Types of people (customers) who make a product successful: 
    1. Innovators - the adventurous ones
    2. Early Adopters - opinion leaders
    3. Early Majority and Late Majority - skeptical mass
    4. Laggards - they have no urgent reason to change
- Connectors, Mavens and Salesmen are translators. They take ideas and information from a highly specialized world and translate them into a language the rest of us can understand. 
- Youngsters commit suicides because they think that it is a way of expressing something. They see it around them happening, so they try it. Same goes with smoking. Smoking is  contagious. But it is not sticky. People smoke because it is a trend. When you tell do not smoke, they will definitely do it. 
- Look at the world around you. It may seem like an immovable, implacable place. It is not with the slightest push - in just the right place - it can be tipped.
