Rich Dad Poor Dad 
by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter

- One of the reasons the rich get richer, the poor get poorer, and the middle class struggles in debt is that the subject of money is taught at home, not in school. 
- Money is one form of power. But what is more powerful is financial education. 
- “That’s how they teach you in school,” he said, smiling. “But that is not how life teaches you, and I would say that life is the best teacher of all. Most of the time, life does not talk to you. It just sort of pushes you around. Each push is life saying, ‘Wake up. There’s something I want you to learn.’” 
- Most people want everyone else in the world to change but themselves. Let me tell you, it’s easier to change yourself than everyone else.” 
- You see, true learning takes energy, passion, and a burning desire. Anger is a big part of that formula, for passion is anger and love combined. 
- If you don’t first handle fear and desire, and you get rich, you’ll only be a highly paid slave. 
- Rule #1: You must know the difference between an asset and a liability, and buy assets. 
- An asset is something that puts money in my pocket. A liability is something that takes money out of my pocket. This is really all you need to know. If you want to be rich, simply spend your life buying assets. If you want to be poor or middle class, spend your life buying liabilities. 
- “Remember the golden rule. He who has the gold makes the rules.” 
- I am not saying don’t buy a house. What I am saying is that you should understand the difference between an asset and a liability. When I want a bigger house, I first buy assets that will generate the cash flow to pay for the house. 
- Net Worth: The difference between your assets and liabilities, which is often filled with a person’s expensive junk and opinions of what things are worth. 
- Wealth is a person’s ability to survive so many number of days forward—or, if I stopped working today, how long could I survive?
- The rich buy assets. The poor only have expenses. The middle class buy liabilities they think are assets. 
- The mistake in becoming what you study is that too many people forget to mind their own business. They spend their lives minding someone else’s business and making that person rich. 
- One of the main reasons net worth is not accurate is simply because, the moment you begin selling your assets, you are taxed for any gains. 
- In my world, real assets fall into the following categories:
• Businesses that do not require my presence I own them, but they are managed or run by other people. If I have to work there, it’s not a business. It becomes my job.
• Stocks 
• Bonds
• Income-generating real estate
• Notes (IOUs) 
• Royalties from intellectual property such as music, scripts, and patents
• Anything else that has value, produces income or appreciates, and has a ready market. 
- Once a dollar goes into your asset column, it becomes your employee. The best thing about money is that it works 24 hours a day and can work for generations. Keep your day job, be a great hardworking employee, but keep building that asset column. 
- Financial IQ is made up of knowledge from four broad areas of expertise:
1. Accounting
2. Investing
3. Understanding markets
4. The Law
- A corporation can do many things that an employee cannot, like pay expenses before paying taxes. That is a whole area of expertise that is very exciting. Employees earn and get taxed, and they try to live on what is left. A corporation earns, spends everything it can, and is taxed on anything that is left. It’s one of the biggest legal tax loopholes that the rich use. 
- It is not gambling if you know what you’re doing. It is gambling if you’re just throwing money into a deal and praying. Of course, there is always risk. It is financial intelligence that improves the odds. 
- The most important specialized skills are sales and marketing. The ability to sell—to communicate to another human being, be it a customer, employee, boss, spouse, or child—is the base skill of personal success. Communication skills such as writing, speaking, and negotiating are crucial to a life of success. 
- The real world is simply waiting for you to get rich. Only a person’s doubts keep them poor. 
- “There is gold everywhere. Most people are not trained to see it.” 
- If a great deal is on the front page, it’s too late in most instances. Look for a new deal. 
- So wise investors must look at more than ROI. They look at the assets they get for free once they get their money back. That is financial intelligence. 
- Whenever you feel short or in need of something, give what you want first and it will come back in buckets. That is true for money, a smile, love, or friendship. 
- Education and wisdom about money are important. Start early. Buy a book. Go to a seminar. Practice. Start small. 
- Taxes are highest on earned income. The least-taxed income is passive income. That is another reason why you want your money working hard for you. The government taxes the income you work hard for more than the income your money works hard for.
