Inner Engineering
by Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev

- Your mind carries the enormous reserves of memory and the incredible possibilities of the imagination that are the result of an evolutionary process of millions of years. If you can use it when you want and put it aside when you don't, the mind can be a fantastic tool.
- Guru means "dispeller of darkness", not to teach, indoctrinate or convert.
- No tradition, however time-honored, deserves to live on as anything more than a museum piece if it has outlived it relevance.
- Language was no more than a conspiracy devised by human beings. If someone spoke, I realized they were only making sounds, and I was making up the meaning.
- Don't look for anything in your life. Just look. Simply look without motive - that is spirituality.
- Yoga is not only about physical fitness. It is a process that could deliver a person to a dimension far beyond the physical.
- Even if you get into yoga for the wrong reasons, it still works.
- We are all seeking to become infinite. The only problem is that we are seeking it in installments.
- For human being, life doesn't seem to end with survival; life begins with survival.
- The only thing that stands between you and your well being is a simple fact: you have allowed you thoughts and emotions to take instructions from the outside rather than inside.
- It is amazing how human beings struggle just to do what every worm, insect, bird and animal does quite effortlessly. 
- The moment you make this fundamental mistake of identifying that is not you as yourself, life becomes an unnecessary struggle. 
- Your logical mind tells you, "Give up all responsibility and you will be free." But in your experience of life, the more you are able to respond to everything around you, the freer you are.
- Through millions of years of evolution, nature has caged you with certain boundaries - this is the human predicament. But this imprisonment is only on the level of biology. On the level of human consciousness, you are like a bird in a cage without a door.
- Love is not something you do; it s just the way you are. 
- Yoga is not an exercise. It is not a technique. It is not a practice. The science of yoga is, quite simply, the science of being in perfect alignment, in absolute harmony, incomplete sync with existence. 
- 5 layers of yoga:
    1. Annamayakosha - food (physical)
    2. Manomayakosha - mental body
    3. Pranamayakosha - energy body
    4. Vignanamayakosha - etheric state (knowledge, transient)
    5. Anandamayakosha - bliss body
- Yoga is bringing karma (action), gnana (intelligence), bhakti (emotions) and kriya (energies) together. 
- Yoga is not about being superhuman; it is about realizing that being human is super. 
- Always try yo be in contact with Earth. Sleep on the floor, spend time gardening, spend time around trees, cover your feet and hands with soil for sometime. 
- Surya namaskara is not a salutation at all. It means organizing solar energies with you, based on the simple logic that all life on Earth is solar-powered. In everything that you eat, drink and breathe, there is an element of the sun. Only if you learn how to better 'digest' the sun, do you truly benefit from this process. 
- Surya namaskara is done to align your body cycle with sun's cycle, which run about 12.25 years (12 postures). Women have an advantage because they are also in sync with lunar cycles (periods). It is an advantage but lot of them treat is as a curse. 
- How long a minute is essentially depends which side of the bathroom door you are! 
- If you try to avoid death, you only end up avoiding life. 
- Be conscious of eating in such a way that within two and a half hours, your food moves out of the stomach, and within twelve to eighteen hours, completely out of the system. 
- Eating natural foods, in their uncooked condition, when the cells are still alive, will bring an enormous sense of health and vitality to the system. 
- The human problem is not enough attention, but too much information. 
- Consumption of a spoonful of ghee on a daily basis a few minutes before a meal does wonders for the digestive system. 
- We are incapable of completely integrating more evolved, intelligent and emotionally endowed creatures into our systems. (About non-vegetarianism). 
- Earliest life forms are easier to consume: Plants -> Trees -> Fish -> Chicken.
- Every creature on this planet has the same right to live as you have. 
- When it comes to food and sleep, your body is the best judge. Don't fix a daily quote of food and sleep. Eat and sleep based on the activity of the body. 
- Sex is not the most powerful urge. Hunger is. 
- Learn to place your intellect in the sheath of your awareness rather than in the sack of memory and identification. 
- Difference between a sleeping person and a dead person is one of awareness. Suppose you are dozing and somebody shocked you awake. Boom! The whole words come back in a single moment! You recreated the whole of existence instantly. 
- If people are not so wracked by fear and guilt, the temples, mosques and churches in the world will not be as congested as they are now. If you wrre naturally joyful, you would go and sit on the beach, or listen to tje whisper of the leaves on the tree. 
- Head vs Heart: There is no separation of head and heart; you are one whole. The way you think is the way you feel, but thought and feeling seem to be different sometimes. It is because thought has a certain clarity, certain agility about it. Emotion is slower. 
- If you want to experience the mountain peak, you either elevate yourself to that level, or simply look up. 
- Confidence and stupidity are very dangerous combination, but they generally go together.
- The difference between an idiot and an enlightened being is thin. 
- That which knows how to bend will not break. Bend your body (yoga) so that it won't break soon!
- Pain is a natural phenomenon, and it is good. Without it, you wouldn't know if a part of your body was chopped off. But suffering is another matter altogether. Pain is bad enough, why make is worse with suffering? Suffering is entirely self-created. 
- Always try to create a distance between you, and everything that you accumulated from outside. 
- The quality of your life is always decided by how you experience life, not by what life offers you. 
- If you know how to make your very body into a temple, going to the temple is not so significant.
