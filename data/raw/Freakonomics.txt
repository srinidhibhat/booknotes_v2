Freakonomics
by Steven D. Levitt, Stephen J. Dubner

- Economics is a science with excellent tools for gaining answers but a serious shortage of interesting questions.
- Morality represents the way that people would like the world to work - whereas economics represents how it actually does work.
- A thing worth having is a thing worth cheating for.
- When a group's information falls into the wrong hands, much of the group's advantage disappears.
- Teachers cheat for incentives so do Sumo wrestlers. But they are hard to detect.
- Information is the currency of internet.
- The gulf between information we publicly proclaim and the information we know to be true is often vast (we say one thing and do another). This can be seen in personal relationships (dating sites), commercial transactions (real-estates) and of course in politics.
- In 1990s America's crime rate decrease drastically because of legalizing abortions but people thought that crime decreased because of different factors.
- A crying baby should never be picked up unless it is in pain. It is an exercise for baby.
- The risks that scare people and the risks that kill people are very different.
- What makes a parent perfect? They think that people who have guns are dangerous and they don't send their children to their houses. But the fact is more deaths are caused by swimming pools rather than by guns!
- Why do parents tend to give high-end names for their child? The name isn't likely to make a shard of difference. But the parents can at least feel better knowing that, from the very outset, that tried their best.
- Teachers and criminals and real estate agents may lie, and politicians and even CIA analyst. But numbers don't!
