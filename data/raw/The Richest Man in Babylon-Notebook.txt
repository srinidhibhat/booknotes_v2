THE RICHEST MAN IN BABYLON
by George S Classon
- “a man’s wealth is not in the purse he carries. A fat purse quickly empties if there be no golden stream to refill it.
- If you would become wealthy, then what you save must earn, and its children must earn, that all may help to give to you the abundance you crave.
- Opportunity is a haughty goddess who wastes no time with those who are unprepared.”
- “Enjoy life while you are here. Do not overstrain or try to save too much. If one-tenth of all you earn is as much as you can comfortably keep, be content to keep this portion. Live otherwise according to your income and let not yourself get niggardly and afraid to spend. Life is good and life is rich with things worthwhile and things to enjoy.”
- A PART OF ALL YOU EARN IS YOURS TO KEEP
- The spirit of procrastination is within all men. We desire riches; yet, how often when opportunity doth appear before us, that spirit of procrastination from within doth urge various delays in our acceptance.
- Good luck can be enticed by accepting opportunity.
- “Those eager to grasp opportunities for their betterment, do attract the interest of the good goddess. She is ever anxious to aid those who please her. Men of action please her best.
- The First Law of Gold Gold cometh gladly and in increasing quantity to any man who will put by not less than one-tenth of his earnings to create an estate for his future and that of his family.
- The Second Law of Gold Gold laboreth diligently and contentedly for the wise owner who finds for it profitable employment, multiplying even as the flocks of the field.
- The Third Law of Gold Gold clingeth to the protection of the cautious owner who invests it under the advice of men wise in its handling.
- The Fourth Law of Gold Gold slippeth away from the man who invests it in businesses or purposes with which he is not familiar or which are not approved by those skilled in its keep.
- The Fifth Law of Gold Gold flees the man who would force it to impossible earnings or who followeth the alluring advice of tricksters and schemers or who trusts it to his own inexperience and romantic desires in investment.
- “Our wise acts accompany us through life to please us and to help us. Just as surely, our unwise acts follow us to plague and torment us. Alas, they cannot be forgotten. In the front rank of the torments that do follow us are the memories of the things we should have done, of the opportunities which came to us and we took not.
- If you desire to help thy friend, do so in a way that will not bring thy friend’s burdens upon thyself.”
- “My debts were my enemies, but the men I owed were my friends for they had trusted me and believed in me.
- The soul of a free man looks at life as a series of problems to be solved and solves them, while the soul of a slave whines, what can I do who am but a slave?’
- If thou thinkest about what a good house thou build, then who cares if the beams are heavy and it is far from the well to carry the water for the plaster. Promise me, boy, if thou get a master, work for him as hard as thou canst. If he does not appreciate all thou do, never mind. Remember, work, well-done, does good to the man who does it. It makes him a better man.’
- “Life is rich with many pleasures for men to enjoy,” Sharru Nada commented. “Each has its place. I am glad that work is not reserved for slaves. Were that the case I would be deprived of my greatest pleasure. Many things do I enjoy but nothing takes the place of work.”
