Surely You're Joking Mr Feynman 
by Richard Feynman

- I don't know what's the matter with people: they don't learn by understanding; they learn by some other way - by rote, or something. Their knowledge is so fragile. 
- People often think I'm a faker, but I'm usually honest, in a certain way - in such a way that often nobody believes me!
- So I found hypnosis to be a very interesting experience. All the time you're saying to yourself, 'I could do that, but I won't' - which is just another way of saying that you can't.
- The trouble with playing a trick on a highly intelligent man like Mr. Teller is that the time it takes him to figure out from the moment that he sees there is something wrong till he understands exactly what happened is too damn small to give you any pleasure.
- The colonel says, 'Just five minutes,' and then he goes to the window and he stops and thinks. That's what they're very good at - making decisions. I thought it was very remarkable how a problem of whether or not information as to how the bomb works should be in the Oak Ridge plant had to be decided and could be decided in five minutes. So I have a great deal of respect for these military guys, because I never can decide anything very important in any length of time at all.
- You don't have to be responsible for the world you're in.
- I was always dumb in that way. I never knew who I was talking to. I was always worried about the physics. If the idea looked lousy, I said it looked lousy. If it looked good, I said it looked good. Simple proposition. I've always lived that way. It's nice, it's pleasant - if you can do it. I'm lucky in my life that I can do this.
- You have no responsibility to live up to what other people think you ought to accomplish. I have no responsibility to be like they expect me to be. It's their mistake, not my failing.
- I went on to work out equations of wobbles. Then I thought about how electron orbits start to move in relativity. And then quantum electrodynamics. And before I knew it (it was a very short time) I was 'playing' - working, really - with the same old problem that I loved so much that I had stopped working on when I went to Los Alamos: my thesis-type problems; all those old-fashioned, wonderful things. 
It was effortless. It was easy to play with these things. It was like uncorking a bottle: Everything flowed out effortlessly. I almost tried to resist it! There was no importance to what I was doing but ultimately there was. The diagrams and the whole business that got the Nobel Prize for came from that piddling around with the wobbling plate.
- I never drank ever again, since then. I suppose I really wasn't in any danger, because I found it very easy to stop. But that strong feeling that I didn't understand frightened me. You see, I get such fun out of thinking that I don't want to destroy this most pleasant machine that makes life such a big kick.
- I had a way of having adventures which is hard to explain: it's like fishing, where you put a line out and then you have to have patience. When I would tell someone about some of my adventures, they might say, 'Oh, come on-let's do that!' So we would go to a bar to see if something will happen, and they would lose patience after twenty minutes or so. You have to spend a couple of days before something happens, on average.
- When you're young, you have all these things to worry about - should you go there, what about your mother. And you worry and try to decide, but then something else comes up. It's much easier to just plain decide. Never mind - nothing is going to change your mind. I did that once when I was a student at MIT. I got sick and tired of having to decide what kind of dessert I was going to have at the restaurant, so I decided it would always be chocolate ice cream, and never worried about it again - Ihad the solution to that problem.
- Of course, you only live one life, and you make all your mistakes, and learn what not to do, and that's the end of you.
-  The first principle is that you must not fool yourself - and you are the easiest person to fool.
-  So I have just one wish for you - the good luck to be somewhere where you are free to maintain the kind of integrity I have described, and where you do not feel forced by a need to maintain your position in the organization, or financial support, or so on, to lose your integrity. May you have that freedom.
