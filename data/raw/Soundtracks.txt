Soundtracks
by Jon Acuff

- When broken soundtracks start playing in your head ask these 3 important question: 
  - 1. Is it true? 
  - 2. Is it helpful? 
  - 3. Is it kind? 
  - And a bonus question: Would you tell it to a friend?
- Removing unwanted thoughts from your head is not like a switch you could turn off (i.e. there is no "one hack" that will mute the thoughts forever). It is a dial that needs to be turned down; through some techniques.
- Turndown techniques:
  - Running
  - Assembling Lego Sets (or Puzzle pieces)
  - Making Lists (food for an overthinking mind)
  - Accomplishing minor tasks - a task you know that can be finished (ex: cleaning a desk)
  - Cup of coffee with a friend
- The antidote for over thinking is not thinking, it is action.
- Along with retiring the old, repetitive and negative soundtracks, it is also important to find new positive ones to replace the old broken ones.
- Borrow positive, nice soundtracks from other people, anybody around the work. One such soundtrack: My life is dope!
- Some good soundtracks to add to your playlist:
  - People are trying to get me money (applicable to work life) 
  - I'll feel awesome, after (when you don't want to do something which is beneficial in longer run)
  - Spare change adds up (to not ignore tiny efforts)
  - Pick ROI (Return on Investment) over EGI (Effective gross income)
  - Pivot, but don't panic (during unexpected tought time, like a pandemic)
- If you are in need of a nice and positive soundtrack, look for an old broken soundtrack playing in your head, and flip it.
- Find a souvenir (can be small or cheap, like a rock) and use it as a reminder for the journey ahead, or the journey you came through. Examples: A seashell from a beach you visited, a compass that always shows true north, a desk plant that indicates growth, an ancient coin etc.
