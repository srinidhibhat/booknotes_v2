The Little Prince (DF Children's Classics Book 4)
by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry
- Grown-ups love figures. When you talk to them about a new friend, they never ask questions about essential matters. They never say to you: 'What does his voice sound like? What games does he prefer? Does he collect butterflies?' They ask you: 'How old is he? How many brothers does he have? How much does he weigh? How much money does his father earn?' It is only then that they feel they know him.
- 'You know… when one is so terribly sad, one loves sunsets…'
- 'I shall have to put up with a few caterpillars if I want to see butterflies.
- One must demand of each and every one what he or she is capable of. Authority is first and foremost based on reason.
- 'Where are the men?' said the little prince. 'One feels rather lonely in the desert.'
'It is just as lonely among men,' said the snake.
- 'Where are the men?' the little prince enquired politely. The flower had once seen a caravan passing. 'Men? I believe there are about six or seven of them. I caught a glimpse of them several years ago. But one never knows where to find them. The wind blows them around. They have no roots which makes their life rather trying.'
- 'Now here is my secret. It is very simple. It is only with one's heart that one can see clearly. What is essential is invisible to the eye.'
- And they heard the roaring thunder of a third brilliantly lit express train. 'Are they pursuing the first travellers?' asked the little prince. 'They are pursuing nothing at all,' said the signalman. 'They sleep in there, or they yawn. Only the children press their noses against the window-panes.' 'Only children know what they are looking for,' said the little prince. 'They dote on a rag doll and it becomes very important to them, and if it is taken away from them, they cry…'
- 'The men where you live,' said the little prince, 'grow five thousand roses in the same garden… and they do not find what they are looking for…'
- One runs the risk of crying a bit if one allows oneself to be tamed…
- If you love a flower which happens to be on a star, it is sweet at night to gaze at the sky. All the stars are
a riot of flowers.'
- 'The stars mean different things to different people. For some they are nothing more than twinkling lights in the sky. For travellers they are guides. For scholars they are food for thought. For my businessman they are wealth. But for everyone the stars are silent. Except from now on just for you…'
'What do you mean?'
'When you look up at the sky at night, since I shall be living on one of them and laughing on one of them, for you it will be as if all the stars were laughing. You and only you will have stars that can laugh!' And as he said it he laughed. 'And when you are comforted (time soothes all sorrows) you will be happy to have known me. You will always be my friend. You will want to laugh with me. And from time to time you will open your window, just for the pleasure of it… And your friends will be astonished to see you laughing whilst gazing at the sky. And so you will say to them, "Yes, stars always make me laugh." And they will think you are crazy. I shall have played a very naughty trick on you…'
