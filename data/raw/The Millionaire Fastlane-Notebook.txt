THE MILLIONAIRE FASTLANE
by MJ DeMarco
- Sometimes clarity washes over you like a peaceful breeze and other times it hits you like a falling Steinway piano.
- Wealth isn’t embodied in a car but in the freedom to know that you can buy it.
- Affordability doesn’t have strings attached.
- So how do you know if you can afford it? If you pay cash and your lifestyle doesn’t change regardless of future circumstances, you can afford it.
- The Law of Victims says you can’t be a victim if you don’t relinquish power to someone capable of making you a victim.
- Most bad situations are consequences of bad choices. Own them and you own your life.
- Life does not begin on Friday night and end Monday morning.
- Folks, you don’t want millions to accompany your cane, you want it to accompany your youth.
- Hoodwinking expenses does not create wealth. Exploding income and controlling expenses creates wealth.
- The Slowlane is predisposed to mediocrity because its mathematical universe is mediocre.
- The Slowlane is a job: your hard work traded for your employer’s cash.
- The Fastlane is about building a better system, a better contraption, a better product, or a better “something” that will leverage your work.
- Reshape life’s focus on producing, not consuming.
- To consume richly, produce richly first.
- Time is the coin of your life. It is the only coin you have, and only you can determine how it will be spent. Be careful, lest you let other people spend it for you. ~ CARL SANDBURG
- To divorce yourself from the Slowlane’s transactional relationship of “time for money,” you need to become a producer, specifically, a business owner.
- A Fastlane objective is to create a business system that survives time, exclusive of your time.
- The 5 money-tree seedlings are rental systems, computer systems, content systems, distribution systems, and human-resource systems.
- Money is the king of money trees. How is money passive? If you have a lot of money, you’re given the gate key to switch teams from consumer to producer.
- Slowlaners start with $5; Fastlaners start with $5 million. Compound interest pays me a lot of money. It’s a tool I use. It’s a great passive income source. Yet, compound interest is not responsible for my wealth.
- The amount of money you have (or don’t have) is a direct reflection on the amount of value you have provided (or not provided).
- Scale creates millionaires. Magnitude creates millionaires. Scale and magnitude creates billionaires.
- If you aren’t where you want to be, the problem is your choices.
- There’s a big chasm between thinking wealth and choosing wealth.
- Worst Case Consequence Analysis helps avoid treasonous choices. The Weighted Average Decision Matrix can help you make better big decisions by clarifying alternatives and their internal factors.
- Ridicule is the tribute paid to the genius by the mediocrities. ~ OSCAR WILDE
- Interest reads a book; commitment applies the book 50 times. Interest wants to start a business; commitment files LLC paperwork. Interest works on your business an hour a day Monday through Friday; commitment works on your business seven days a week whenever time permits.
- I’d rather be a one-hit wonder than a no-hit wonder. One hit is all it takes, and you could be set for life.
- Stop thinking about business in terms of your selfish desires, whether it’s money, dreams or “do what you love.” Instead, chase needs, problems, pain points, service deficiencies, and emotions.
- So the next time you’re trolling the web looking to make money, sit back and ask yourself, “What do I have to offer the world?” Offer the world value, and money becomes magnetized to you!
- Help one million people and you will be a millionaire.
- FASTLANE PURITY: FIVE COMMANDMENTS Thou shalt not invest in a needless business. Thou shalt not trade time for money. Thou shalt not operate on a limited scale. Thou shalt not relinquish control. Thou shalt not let a business startup be an event over process.
- The owner of an idea is not he who imagines it, but he who executes it.
- Execution is taking the neurological fart that is an idea and making it smell like a rose.
- Any time you positively violate your customer’s expectations, they buy from you again. Then they become unpaid human resource systems, liaisons, disciples, and free advertisers. All build speed. And speed builds wealth.
- Fanatical customer service can overcome shortcomings, but fanatical features can’t overcome poor customer service.
- Everyone has an invisible sign hanging from their neck saying, ‘Make me feel important.’ Never forget that message when working with people. ~ MARY KAY ASH
- Ten businesses earning $10,000 cumulatively are not better than one business that does it single-handedly.
