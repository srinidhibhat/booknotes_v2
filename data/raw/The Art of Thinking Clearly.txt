The Art of Thinking Clearly
by Rolf Dobelli

- Do not overestimate your possibilities of success. Visit cemeteries of those who failed trying. There will be lots. 
- The human brain seeks patterns and rules. In fact, if it finds no familiar pattern. it simply invents some. When it comes to pattern recognition, we are oversensitive. 
- "What the human being is best at doing is interpreting all new information so that their prior conclusions remain intact." - Warren Buffet
- 'I lost so much money with this stock. I can't sell it now' - This is irrational. Forget the past. Example: You pay Rs.100 for a movie. You watch for 30 minutes. It is terrible. But you think 'I paid Rs.100 for this. I can't go now.' Don't think about past. Just get up and go. 
- We attach too much likelihood to spectacular flashy or loud outcomes. Anything silent or invisible we downgrade in our minds. We think dramatically, not qualitatively. We prefer a wrong map to no map at all. 
- "It will get worse before it gets better" - Not always true. Think when someone says this. 
- Instead of reading histories that are written after a huge event (Ex: War), read diaries or personal notes written before or during the events. You will see how much poor forecaster a human is. The world is really unpredictable. 
- Overconfidence: Difference between what people actually know and how much they *think* they know. 
- Never judge a decision purely by its result. A bad result does not automatically indicate a bad decision and vice versa. 
- A Tip to eliminate Groupthink consequences: If you lead a group, appoint someone as devil's advocate. She will not be the most popular member of the team, but she might be the most important. 
- A loss *weighs* about twice that of a similar gain. If you want to convince someone about something, don't focus on advantages; instead highlight how it helps them dodge the disadvantage. 
- 70 is a magic number for exponential growth. Example: Each year, number of traffic accidents rises by 7%. That means doubling time = 70/7 = 10 i.e. Number of traffic accidents double every 10 years! Another example: Inflation is at 5%. Doubling time = 70/5 = 14 i.e. In 14 years, a dollar will be worth only half what it is today!
- Decision Fatigue: Intensive decision making will drain your willpower. Take a break, relax for sometime when you are affected from decision making. 
- It is okay to be envious - but only of the person you aspire to become. 
- Suppose you are running a charity and go on asking money from random strangers. The donation you get by showing a photo of a malnourished child is lot more than mentioning a statistic such as "A famine has affected 3 million children, please donate". **Statistics don't stir us; people do.**
- If you face a consequential decision inside your circle of competence (area of expertise) think intuitively i.e. based on your gut feeling. Outside the circle, apply the hard, slow and relational thinking. Often we do the opposite.
