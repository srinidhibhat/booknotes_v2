Eat that Frog
by Brian Tracy

- If the first thing you do each morning is to eat a live frog, you can go through the day with the satisfaction of knowing that that is probably the worst thing that is going to happen to you all day long. (Frog - biggest most important task). 
- First rule of frog eating is: "If you have to eat two frogs, eat the ugliest one first."
- Second rule of frog eating is: "If you have to eat a live frog at all, it doesn't pay to sit and look at it for very long."
- 80/20 rule: 20% off your activities will account for 80% of your results.
- Do things first and second things not at all.
- Ask yourself: What one skill, if I developed, and did it in an excellent fashion, would have the greatest positive impact on my career?
- It is quality of time at work that counts and quantity of time at home that matters.
- If you are not getting better you are getting worse.
- By the yard it's hard. But inch by inch anything is a cinch.
- The last great freedom of mankind is the freedom to choose your attitude under any set of external conditions.
- Difficulties come not to obstruct, but to instruct.
- Optimism:
    1. Look for good in every situation.
    2. Seek valuable lesson in every setback.
    3. Look for solution to every problem.
    4. Think and talk continually about the goals.
- There is more to life than just increasing its speed - Mahatma Gandhi.
- The momentum principle: Although it might take tremendous amounts of energy to overcome inertia and get started initially, it then takes far less energy to keep going.
- Determine the most valuable and important thing you could possibly do at every single moment and then, "Eat that frog!"
