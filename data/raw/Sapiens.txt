Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind
by Yuval Noah Harari

- There was humans long before there was history. 
- Animals are said to belong to the same species if they tend to mate with each other, giving birth to fertile offspring. 
- Biologists label organisms with a two-part Latin name, genus followed by species. Genus means 'evolved from common ancestor. Ex: Panthera Leo (Genus - Panthers, Species - Leo i.e. Lion). Homo Sapiens (Species - Sapiens i.e. wise, Genus - Homo i.e. Man). 
- The animals which were in the top of the food chain before humans (like Lions and Sharks) evolved into that position very gradually, over millions of years. This enabled the ecosystem to develop checks and balances that prevent Lions and Sharks from wrecking too much havoc. In contrast, humankind ascended to the top so quickly that the ecosystem was not given time to adjust. Moreover, humans themselves failed to adjust. Many historical calamities, from deadly wars to ecological catastrophe, have resulted from this over-hasty jump. 
- Whereas chimpanzees spend five hours a day chewing raw food, a single hour suffices for people eating cooked food. 
- Cognitive Revolution happened 70,000 years ago. 
- One of the major reason for cognitive revolution in Sapiens is the language. Of course, other species have languages too. But they use it only when they are in danger, or in search of food (survival). But Sapiens use it for gossip, imagination etc. Sapiens can cooperate in extremely flexible ways with countless number of strangers. That's why Sapiens rule the world. Where ants eat our leftovers and chimps are locked up in zoos. 
- The Cognitive Revolution is the point when history declared its independence from biology. Until Cognitive Revolution, the doings of all human species belonged to the realm of biology. 
- Ever since the Cognitive Revolution. there hasn't been a single natural way of life for Sapiens. There are only cultural choices, from among a bewildered palette of possibilities. 
- The human collective knows far more today than did the ancient bands. But at the individual level, ancient foragers were the most knowledgeable and skillful people in history. 
- The first wave of Sapiens colonization was one of the biggest and swiftest ecological disasters to befall the animal kingdom. Homo Sapiens drove to extinction about half of the planet's big beasts long before humans invented the wheel, writing or iron tools. 
- Animals adapt to ecosystems. But Sapiens transform the ecosystems. 
- If our minds are those of hunter-gatherers, our cuisine is that of ancient farmers. 
- Agricultural Revolution happened 10,000 years ago. 
- The Agricultural Revolution was history's biggest fraud, we didn't domesticated plants (as many believe), plants domesticated us. We satisfied their every need and are forced to settle permanently next to them (Ex: Wheat fields). Note: Here plants mean only handful of species like wheat, rice and potatoes. 
- Evolution: The currency of evolution is neither hunger nor pain, but rather copies of DNA helixes. Just as economic success of a company is measured only by number of dollars in its bank account, not by happiness of its employees. So the evolutionary success of a species is measured by number of copies of its DNA. 
- The essence of Agricultural Revolution: The ability to keep more people live under worse conditions. 
- Humanity's search for an easier life released immense forces of change that transformed the world in ways nobody envisioned or wanted. 
- In evolutionary terms, cattle represents one of the most successful animal species ever to exist. At the same time, they are some of the most miserable animals on the planet (because of their sufferings to fulfill the man's needs). 
- History is something that very few people have been doing while everyone else was ploughing field and carrying water buckets. 
- Birds fly not because they have a right to fly, but because they have wings. 
- 'There is no God, but don't tell that to my servant, lest he murder me at night' - Imagined order. 
- There is no way out of imagined order. When we break down our prison walls and run towards freedom, we are in fact running into the more spacious exercise yard of a bigger prison. 
- The first texts of history contain no philosophical insights, no poetry, legends, laws, or even royal triumphs. They are humdrum economic documents, recording the payment of taxes, the accumulation of debts and the ownership of taxes. 
- The first recorded name in history - Kushim, belongs to an accountant, rather than a prophet, a poet or a great conqueror. 
- Our computers have trouble understanding how Homo Sapiens talks, feels and dreams. So we are teaching Homo Sapiens to talk, feel and dream in the language of numbers, which can be understood by computers. 
- About attraction or relation between same sex: Biology is willing to tolerate wide spectrum of possibilities. It's culture that obliges people realise some possibilities while forbidding others. 
- Culture tends to argue that it forbids only that which is unnatural. But from biological perspective, nothing is unnatural. A truly unnatural behavior, that goes against laws of nature, simply cannot exist. Ex: A Girl running faster than speed of light. 
- Sex is a biological category, whereas, gender is a cultural category. 
- People who do not believe in the same goal or obey the same king are more than willing to use the same money. 
- The sum total of money in the world is about $60 Trillion. Yet the sum total of coins and banknotes is less than $6 Trillion. More than 90% of all money exists only on computer servers. 
- Religion asks us yo believe in something, money asks us to believe that other people believe in something i.e. money itself is just worthless paper, we value it so much because others value it as well. 
- No culture is pure or untouched from its origin. At some point in history, a culture had to adopt and adapt to the principles of other cultures. For example, India follows Hinduism. But we still follow many fragments of western culture (Human rights, railways etc.) and Islamic (The Taj Mahal) and we're proud of it (many are). 
- Today, religion is often considered a source of discrimination and disunion. Yet, in fact, religion has been the third great unifier of humankind, alongside money and empires. 
- Belief in superhuman order + Human norms and values = Religion. 
- Revolutions are, by definition, unpredictable. A predictable revolution never erupts. 
- Scientific Revolution happened around 500 years ago (1500 AD). 
-     | Year 1500 | Now
Population | 500 Million | 7 Billion
Total value of goods and Services | 350 Billion $ | 60 Trillion $
Consumption of Energy | 13 Trillion calories per day | 1500 Trillion calories per day
- On 20 July 1969, humans landed on moon. During previous 4 Billion years of evolution, no organism managed even to leave earth's atmosphere. 
- But single most remarkable and defining moment of past 500 years came at 05:29:45 on 16 July 1945. At that precise second American scientists detonated 1st Atomic bomb at Alamogodro, New Mexico. From that point onward, humankind had the capability not only to change the course of history, but to end it. 
- Earlier traditions usually formulated theories in terms of stories. Modern science uses Mathematics. Newton showed that the book of nature is written in the language of Mathematics. 
- Poverty, sickness, wars, famines, old age and death itself were not the inevitable fate of humankind. They were simply the fruits of our ignorance. 
- The leading project of the scientific revolution is to give humankind eternal life. 
- Scientific research can flourish only in alliance with some religion or ideology. 
- If geniuses like Galileo, Columbus and Charles Darwin had never been born, their insights would probably have occurred to others. But if the proper funding in scientific researches were unavailable, no intellectual brilliance could have compensated for that. 
- In 1775, Asia accounted for 80% of the world economy. The combined economies of India and China alone represented two-thirds of global production. 
- Fewer than 5,000 British officials, about 40,000 - 70,000 British soldiers, and perhaps another 100,000 business people, wives and children were sufficient to conquer and rule up to 300 million Indians. Reasons: Superior Knowledge, Science, Curiosity of Europeans.
- On 15th September 1830, the first commercial railway line was opened connecting Liverpool with Manchester. The trains moved under the same steam power that had previously pumped water and moved textile looms. A mere 20 years later, Britain had tens of thousands of kilometers of railway tracks. At heart, the Industrial Revolution has been a revolution in energy conversion. 
- Usually, when we think of Industrial Revolution, we think of an urban landscape of smoking chimneys, or the plight of exploited coal miners sweating in the bowels of the earth. Yet the Industrial Revolution was above all else, the second Agricultural Revolution: Humans just started to treat animals like cows and hens as machines producing goods. 
- Each year the US population spends more money on diets than the amount needed to feed all the hungry people in the rest of the world. 
- The Capitalist and Consumerist ethics are two sides of the same coin, a merger of two commandments. The supreme commandment of the rich is 'Invest'. The supreme commandment of the rest of us is 'Buy!'
- Millions of years of evolution have designed us to live and think as community members. Within a mere 2 centuries we have become alienated individuals. Reason: Industrial Revolution. 
- Any attempt to define the characteristics of modern society is akin to defining the color of a chameleon. The only characteristic of which we can be certain is the incessant change. 
- At least some of the praise usually heaped on Mahatma Gandhi for his non-violent creed is actually owed to the British Empire: they wanted peace too. 
- For real peace is not mere absence of war. Real peace is the implausibility of war. 
- We can congratulate ourselves on the unprecedented accomplishments of modern Sapiens only if we completely ignore the fate of all other animals. 
- In a Biological perspective, a person's happiness level is genetic. Some persons are always cheerful whatever the situation. But some are always not content with their happiness, because their genes doesn't allow them to go beyond a certain happiness level.
