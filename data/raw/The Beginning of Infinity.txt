The Beginning of Infinity

- That is what makes good explanations essential to science: it is only when a theory is a good explanation - hard to vary - that it even matters whether it is testable. Bad explanations are equally useless whether they are testable or not.
- Some people become depressed at the scale of the universe, because it makes them feel insignificant. Other people are relieved to feel insignificant, which is even worse. But, in any case, those are mistakes. Feeling insignificant because the universe is large has exactly the same logic as feeling inadequate for not being a cow. Or a herd of cows. The universe is not there to overwhelm us; it is our home, and our resource. The bigger the better.
- This increasingly intimate connection between explaining the world and controlling it is no accident, but is part of the deep structure of the world.
- It is inevitable that we face problems, but no particular problem is inevitable. We survive, and thrive, by solving each problem as it comes up.
- Although the existence of progress in the biosphere is what the theory of evolution is there to explain, not all evolution constitutes progress. and no (genetic) evolution optimizes progress.
- Biological evolution does not optimize benefits to the species, the group, the individual or even the gene, but only the ability of the gene to spread through the population.
- In reality, explanations do not form a hierarchy with the lowest level being the most fundamental. Rather, explanations at any level of emergence can be fundamental.
- The jump to universality: The tendency of gradually improving systems to undergo a sudden large increase in functionality, becoming universal in some domain.
- We do not know why the world is explicable. But eventually we shall. And when we do, there will be infinitely more left to explain.
- If unlimited progress really is going to happen, not only are we now at almost the very beginning of it, we always shall be.
- A probability of one in 250,000 of such an impact in any given year means that a typical person on Earth would have a far larger chance of dying of an asteroid impact than in aeroplane crash. And the next such object to strike us is already out there at this moment, speeding towards us with nothing to stop it except human knowledge.
- Whenever we try to improve things and fail, it is not because the spiteful gods are thwarting us or punishing us for trying, or because we have reached a limit on the capacity of reason to make improvements, or because it is best that we fail, but always because we did not know enough, in time.
- Like every other destruction of optimism, whether in a whole civilization or in a single individual, these must have been unspeakable catastrophes for those who had dared to expect progress. But we should feel more than sympathy for those people. We should take it personally. For if any of those earlier experiments in optimism had succeeded, our species would be exploring the stars by now, and you and I would be immortal.
- Indeed, most guesses are not new knowledge. Although guesswork is the origin of all knowledge, it is also a source of error, and therefore what happens to an idea after it has been guessed is crucial.
- What voters are doing in elections is not synthesizing a decision of a superhuman being, 'Society'. They are choosing which experiments are to be attempted next, and (principally) which are to be abandoned because there is no longer a good explanation for why they are best. The politicians, and their policies, are those experiments.
- Imitation is not at the heart of human meme replication. Parrots copy distinctive sounds; apes copy purposeful movements of a certain limited class. But humans do not especially copy any behaviour. They use conjecture, criticism and experiment to create good explanations of the meaning of things-other people's behaviour, their own, and that of the world in general. That is what creativity does.
- It was specifically creativity that made the difference between ape memes - expensive in terms of the time and effort required to replicate them, and inherently limited in the knowledge that they were capable of expressing - and human memes, which are efficiently transmitted and universal in their expressive power. The beginning of creativity was, in that sense, the beginning of infinity.
- Replicating memes unchanged is the function for which creativity evolved. And that is why our species exists.
- Many people have an aversion to infinity of various kinds. But there are some things that we do not have a choice about. There is only one way of thinking that is capable of making progress, or of surviving in the long run, and that is the way of seeking good explanations through creativity and criticism. What lies ahead of us is in any case infinity. All we can choose is whether it is an infinity of ignorance or of knowledge, wrong or right, death or life.
