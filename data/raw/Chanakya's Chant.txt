Chanakya's Chant
by Ashwin Sanghi

- It is impossible to know when a fish swimming in water drinks some of it. Thus it's quite impossible to find out when government servants in charge of undertakings misappropriate money. 
- Politics is war without bloodshed and war is simply politics with bloodshed. 
- You can do much more with a kind word and a gun than a kind word alone. 
- Character is what you are. Reputation is what people think you are. 
- Worry is like a rocking chair. It keeps you busy but gets you nowhere. 
- Some cause happiness wherever they go. Others whenever they go. 
- Every thing is always alright in the end. If it isn't alright, then it isn't the end. 
- Sometimes it's rather easier to get forgiveness than permission. 
- Wise men think all they say, fools say all they think. 
- A little inaccuracy sometimes saves a ton of explanation.
