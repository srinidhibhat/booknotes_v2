It doesn’t matter whether this is your experience right now,” he said, “simply imagine for a moment that this is how things are. In fact, think back to the last time you felt very happy and relaxed and it’s probably not so very difficult to imagine. Okay,” he said, “now imagine a very cloudy day, no blue sky at all, just big, dark, heavy clouds.” He said each word very slowly, as if to emphasize the point. “How does that make you feel?” he asked, still smiling, “not so good, right? Now, imagine those clouds are the thoughts in your mind, how sometimes they’re fluffy and white and appear quite friendly, whereas at other times they appear dark and heavy. The color of the clouds simply reflects your feeling or mood at the time. In order to get to this monastery you must have flown in a plane?” he asked, knowing full well what the answer would be. I agreed. “Was it cloudy when you left?” he asked. “It’s always cloudy in England,” I replied, smiling. “Well then,” he said, “you’ll know that if you get in a plane and fly up through the clouds, there’s nothing but blue sky on the other side. Even when it appears as though there’s nothing but big, dark, heavy clouds, there’s always blue sky there.” There was no denying it, I’d flown a lot over the years and he was right. “So,” he said, shrugging his shoulders, “the sky is always blue.”",

Diego, the knife. What followed was very dramatic. But the real drama had already played out in the bathroom. It had played out when, for reasons I don’t understand, I was unable to climb through the mirror and send out my sixteen-year-old self in my place. Until that moment she had always been there. No matter how much I appeared to have changed—how illustrious my education, how altered my appearance—I was still her. At best I was two people, a fractured mind. She was inside, and emerged whenever I crossed the threshold of my father’s house. That night I called on her and she didn’t answer. She left me. She stayed in the mirror. The decisions I made after that moment were not the ones she would have made. They were the choices of a changed person, a new self. You could call this selfhood many things. Transformation.

The oriental coffee tables and well-worn desks that have been handed down from generation to generation? Despite being “out of fashion,” not only do they add beauty to our daily lives, they lend material credibility to our presumption that the passing of an era will be glacial. But under certain circumstances, the Count finally acknowledged, this process can occur in the comparative blink of an eye. Popular upheaval, political turmoil, industrial progress—any combination of these can cause the evolution of a society to leapfrog generations, sweeping aside aspects of the past that might otherwise have lingered for decades. And this must be especially so, when those with newfound power are men who distrust any form of hesitation or nuance, and who prize self-assurance above all.",

That is, if a man woke no later than six, engaged in a light repast, and then applied himself without interruption, by the hour of noon he should have accomplished a full day’s labor. Thus, in his father’s view, the toll of twelve was a moment of reckoning. When the noon bell sounded, the diligent man could take pride in having made good use of the morning and sit down to his lunch with a clear conscience. But when it sounded for the frivolous man—the man who had squandered his morning in bed, or on breakfast with three papers, or on idle chatter in the sitting room—he had no choice but to ask for his Lord’s forgiveness. In the afternoon, the Count’s father believed that a man should take care not to live by the watch in his waistcoat—marking the minutes as if the events of one’s life were stations on a railway line. Rather, having been suitably industrious before lunch, he should spend his afternoon in wise liberty. That is, he should walk among the willows, read a timeless text, converse with a friend beneath the pergola, or reflect before the fire—engaging in those endeavors that have no appointed hour, and that dictate their own beginnings and ends.",

And how that notion pained me. How it unsettled me. Exhausted as I was, the very thought of it could keep me tossing until dawn. “Then one night, he came to me in a dream, Sasha: Mayakovsky himself. He quoted some lines of verse—beautiful, haunting lines that I had never heard before—about the bark of a birch tree glinting in the winter sun. Then he loaded his revolver with an exclamation point and put the barrel to his chest. When I awoke, I suddenly understood that this propensity for self-destruction was not an abomination, not something to be ashamed of or abhorred; it was our greatest strength. We turn the gun on ourselves not because we are more indifferent and less cultured than the British, or the French, or the Italians. On the contrary.

The mark of whether you are made for a task is not whether you love it but whether you can handle the pain of the task easier than most people. When are you enjoying yourself while other people are complaining? The work that hurts you less than it hurts others is the work you were made to do. What makes me lose track of time? Flow is the mental state you enter when you are so focused on the task at hand that the rest of the world fades away.19 This blend of happiness and peak performance is what athletes and performers experience when they are “in the zone.” It is nearly impossible to experience a flow state and not find the task satisfying at least to some degree. Where do I get greater returns than the average person? We are continually comparing ourselves to those around us, and a behavior is more likely to be satisfying when the comparison is in our favor. When I started writing at jamesclear.com, my email list grew very quickly. I wasn’t quite sure what I was doing well, but I knew that results seemed to be coming faster for me than for some of my colleagues, which motivated me to keep writing. What comes naturally to me? For just a moment, ignore what you have been taught. Ignore what society has told you. Ignore what others expect of you. Look inside yourself and ask, “What feels natural to me? When have I felt alive? When have I felt like the real me?” No internal judgments or people-pleasing. No second-guessing or self-criticism. Just feelings of engagement and enjoyment. Whenever you feel authentic and genuine, you are headed in the right direction.",

As you listen to the thought, you feel a conscious presence — your deeper self — behind or underneath the thought, as it were. The thought then loses its power over you and quickly subsides, because you are no longer energizing the mind through identification with it. This is the beginning of the end of involuntary and compulsive thinking.",

It is not a moving up but a continuous flowing; you move up to keep the flow going. There is no possible reason for climbing except the climbing itself; it is a self-communication.”",

Preferably adopt the crosslegged posture or sit at your usual dining place. While eating: Drink a glass of water. Start eating (preferably with your hands) and eat slowly. Chew your food slowly and deliberately. Use the entire mouth and don’t just chew from 1 side of your jaw. While you still have food in your mouth don’t pick up the food from your plate (Keeping food ready in your hands or on your spoon means you are eating fast and will ultimately overeat.) Eat with all your senses and think about how the food is nourishing you from within. Now if you want to eat some more, serve yourself a second helping from the other half that’s left. But don’t eat it all. After eating Don’t be in a rush to get up and get going. Stay where you are for a few minutes. If you’re clearing up yourself, pick up your plate and clean it with water before leaving it in the sink. (Food that dries up on the plate will sometimes stay on the plate even after washing, and can cause stomach discomfort at a later point.)",

    "text": "Carbs you should never eat (these are high GI and zero on nutrient) And how to cheat on them 1. Biscuit Eat them when you’ve done a very long physical activity like trekking, 2 or more hours of walking or shopping. In day to day life, restrict to one a week! I think biscuits are more harmful than cakes and pastries because no one worries about scarfing them down. 2. Cakes and pastries If you can’t bear to give up your favourite chocolate pastry, you’re in for good news. Have it first thing in the morning. Don’t replace your nutritious meal with this but have it in addition to it. Croissant lovers go ahead as well. But don’t indulge yourself more than once or twice a month. 3. Pizza One slice (we’re talking fast food pizza) and as a meal by itself. Perfect for after a long boring meeting. 4. Drink syrups, cold drinks (all drinks made from these, including sherbets, etc) After being out in the sun for a long while; the sugar will have less of an effect. Also after a long day or if you’re on holiday, have one every 2 to 3 days. 5. Mithais and all desserts (chocolates, etc included) Eat as a meal by itself. Have your mithai either an hour and a half after your lunch, or first thing in the morning. Again not more than once a month, if you have to have it! 6. Deep-fried food like samosas, pakoras, vada, bhujiya and kachori Eat first thing in the morning. Halve your first meal and have your deep-fried goody along with it, or as a meal by itself later in the afternoon. But restrict yourself to only one of these. And do not eat a mithai with it. You can have one of these treats once a week, but again only if you’re eating correctly all seven days and working out at least three hours a week. 7. Sugar 2 teaspoons a day max. Most of you have this in your tea or coffee, so bear this in mind… 8. Alcohol With a meal or after a meal. Never on an empty stomach and never have anything deep-fried with it. Carbs to eat through the day that ensure optimum fat burning and sustained release of blood sugar (these are low GI foods): Carbs to be consumed after exercise or any stressful activity (high GI foods): Phulkas or rotis made from gehu or wholewheat atta, jowar, bajra and nachni/ragi. Also idli, dosa, uttapam, appam, neer dosa, upma, brown rice, wholewheat bread, oats, barley, semolina/ rawa/suji, vegetable parathas, koki, homemade khakra, dhokla, iddada, besan or mung dal dosa, chillas, sweet potatoes, unripe banana, all lentils. Boiled potato All fruits White rice and dal White bread sandwiches or toast Fruit juices Homemade ladoos How to eat them How to eat them With vegetables and in small quantities. They can be part of your breakfast, lunch and an evening meal by 5:30-6 pm. Within ten minutes of your workout. I don’t usually recommend fruit juices but this is a safe time to have it. As for rice and dal, for anyone who works out at home, this could be an option depending on when you workout. You can also eat fruits first thing in the morning.",
